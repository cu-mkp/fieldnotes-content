In the lab class at Fayerweather Hall, we learnt some new codes on Git Bash. We learnt how to put a new entry into a file with the sign &gt; and how to append text to a file with the sign &gt;&gt;. we also learnt the use of piping and how it helps to convert the output into an input for a new command in a single line. For our homework, we were to append all the contents of our assigned folios into a single text file titled &lt;name&gt;_all_folios.txt and push it on to the remote repository on Github.<br />
<br />
The process appeared to be simple so I began to work on it at night. With the &gt;&gt; command I appended a few documents, and to be sure, I verified the content with the command cat &lt;filename&gt;. I accidentally missed the code &gt;&gt; and instead typed &gt; so my previous inputs got erased. I began to redo the process after realizing that at this moment, it requires some serious concentration because it is pretty easy to miss a step.<br />
<br />
After the file was complete with all the required folios, I tried to do a git commit. An error showed up that the files were untracked. I checked some guide on Google and recognized that I had to use the command git add as well. After git add, I entered git commit. My git bash seemed to freeze and I had to use the command ctrl d to kill it.<br />
