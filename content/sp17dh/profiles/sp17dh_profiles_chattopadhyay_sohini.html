   Sohini Chattopadhyay is a PhD student in the History of the Modern South Asia with interests in History of Science and public health, history of colonialism, urban history, and genealogies of the dead body. Her research interests are in reorganizations of burial and cremation patterns through different techniques and machines, and in making new uses of dead bodies in the 19th and 20th centuries, in Bombay, Calcutta and New Delhi. She specially focuses on urban municipalities and their interfaces with new groups that grew to assist in burials and cremations and to pose questions on rituals and 'colonial science'. She also has a keen interest in exploring digital tools that help in research analysis and representation. Prior to this, she received an M.A. in Modern Indian History from Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi.
