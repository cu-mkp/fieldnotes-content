    Subject: Filling the Metadata Template (Folios p074r-p079v)
   </strong>
   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 14px;">
    Filling the template for the metadata doesn't goes as easy as expected. The informations in the recipes do not always perfectly fit for the categories in the template.
   </span>
   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 14px;">
    1. The first technical problem is Google Sheet only allow one hyperlink per cell. When the text of a recipe appears across tow folios, I need to type both of the url into one cell. The two links then merge as one by default, which could not work when click to browse the page. When figures for the recipe is specifically added into the transcription, should we just add the link of the whole page which includes the figure or add the link of the figure separately? (as in the case
   </span>
   <span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Arial;">
    p077r_a2
   </span>
   <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 14px;">
    )
   </span>
   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 14px;">
    2. The main problem I encountered is the ingredients of the recipe. In the folios in Google Drive, the materials in the recipes just marked by the “&lt;m&gt;...&lt;/m&gt;” code which I assume to be materials. The instruments in the recipe are not marked as the same. However, some marked materials seems ambiguous concerning its status in the recipes. They are not ingredients, and also can not count into instruments. For example the water for soaking (p074v_2), marble used to put materials on when burnishing (p075r_2, p078v_1,p078v_4), charcoal or manual or dung used for heating (p074r_3, p076r_1, p078r_3), paper or cards used when crushing (p077r_a4), wood or tooth used for burnishing (p074v_3, p078v_1, p078v_2).
   </span>
   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 14px;">
    3. Concerning the problem above, is it necessary to change the ingredients to materials, or add another category as instruments?
   </span>
   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 14px;">
    4. When the ingredients in the recipe mention an alternative (e.g.:
   </span>
   <span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Arial;">
    p075v_1, currier water or rainwater
   </span>
   <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 14px;">
    ), should we count it as one or two?
   </span>
   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 14px;">
    5. Standard subcategories for the activity need to be developed and followed.
   </span>
   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 14px;">
    6. How specificity should the final products be described, the titles of the recipes sometimes indicate the final products as yellow varnish, red gum, green wood, etc. Should we just categorize them as varnish, or should we make the final products as specific as possible?
   </span>
   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 14px;">
    7. The end products of some medical recipes is hard to describe, like the case in p077r_a1 (wearing a lead cap or mask), p079v_2 (having something in front when working with hazardous metals).
   </span>
   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 14px;">
    8. Should the annotation of a recipe just include those used it as a main text for analysis, or should it include those just mentioned it as a reference in the text or just in a footnote?
