<br />
Attended a lecture by Henry Maison from Brandeis University on computations behind desgigning and creating - in this case, designing musical instruments like the cello or the violin.<br />
<br />
Mairson premised his lecture on the idea that behind every creation, there is an algorithm which is commonly called method. On the basis of this idea, he converted designs and instructions into a computational language. It resulted in Digital Amati, which is a free software. It solved issues of time, and even proper copy of design. For example, earlier violins were getting bigger because of manual copy through templates. His software is based on geometry rather than complicated equations. He realized that tech writing is difficult to comprehend, but one solution was to create a programming language. Program writing is just another form of writing like grant applications or love letters - here, people express algorithmic ideas to each other.<br />
<br />
He then proceeded to explain the intricacies and methodologies embedded in his software<br />
