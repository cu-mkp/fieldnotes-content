    Name:
   </strong>
   Nina Elizondo-Garza, Tenzin Dongchung
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <strong>
    Process:
   </strong>
   <br/>
   Step One of Plan: Re-create recipes for rye flour stucco, chalk stucco, plaster stucco that takes 15 days to make (if possible?) and lead white stucco* using wooden and metal molds
   <br/>
   Step two of plan: In conjunction with Tenzin's papier mache research, experiment with making molds and impromptu masks out of papier mache/carton
   <br/>
   *lead white is an ingredient of the third stucco recipe, but it is clearly used as a colorant to make the stucco whiter. It will be used in small quantities, and generally, the stucco we make using lead white will be small molds (possibly disposable ones?)
   <br/>

    Recipes from MS Fr. 640
   </strong>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   p029r_1 - Stucco for Molding.
   <br/>
   Includes the recipe for both flour and chalk based stucco
   <br/>
   <br/>
   p080_2 -Very Hard White stucco
   <br/>
   This recipe has no instructions, features four ingredients, and one of them is ceruse.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   p084r_a1 - Impromptu Masks
   <br/>
   Instructions for 'life casting' using papier mache, as well as drying instructions, and ways to re-use the paper mache masks (crushing them up to re-use the powder for another papier mache product).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <strong>
    Schematic plan:
   </strong>
   <br/>
   Check Cennini, Marciano, and Baldenucci(sp? From Jo's presentation on Monday Oct. 16)
   <br/>
   Research the use of stucco in 'ephemera' and in permanent architecture and discern what they were made of in Early Modern period including what patterns/molds they used and what these would have been made of.
   <br/>
   A cursory search on CLIO has revealed a plethora of books on historical stucco -- most of them are in Italian, which I can get through. Some of these discuss stucco, some include images/engravings of historical stucco, others include information on how best to repair/preserve historical stucco.

   <strong>
    Required Ingredients
   </strong>
   - comments in brackets indicate there is none in the spreadsheet or other questions, etc.
   <br/>
   Rye flour [will need more since there's none left according to the spreadsheet]
   <br/>
   tragacanth gum
   <br/>
   Chalk powder
   <br/>
   Plaster (powder?) [of Paris?]
   <br/>
   Linseed oil (unsure if normal, stand, etc)
   <br/>
   Water
   <br/>
   White Wax [white beeswax in inventory]
   <br/>
   venice turpentine
   <br/>
   eggshell
   <br/>
   ceruse*
   <br/>
   <br/>
   cotton cheese cloth
   <br/>
   mortar and pestle
   <br/>
   slab and muller
   <br/>
   scale
   <br/>
   rolling pin
   <br/>
   <br/>
   I have metal and wooden molds I can bring (but I would like to be able to take them back once the experiment has concluded? Is this possible?)
   <br/>
   <br/>
   *Obviously, ceruse is toxic, so I will draw up the safety protocols
