   I am a first year MA student in the GSAS, pursuing a degree in History of Art and Archaeology with a focus on European/Christian medieval and early modern religious art as well as folk art and how it relates to folk traditions. I graduated from Rice University in 2014 with BAs in Religious Studies and in Psychology, then worked in a policy-centered NGO in DC. My undergraduate thesis was about the iconographies used by charismatic dictators and how they mirrored and/or appropriated religious iconography. My NGO work focused on Latin America. I am interested in the M&amp;K project to better understand medieval and early modern craft, particularly regarding medicine, and magic and aprotopaic items.
