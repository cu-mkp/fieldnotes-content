   <span style="font-size: 120%;">
    I decided to use our (FA17) reconstruction template before starting the project. From last week's mustard reconstruction process, I felt that if I spent more time researching the materials, it might have offered us more options/details on processes as well as ingredients. So, I started with the annotation reading on Sulfur and additives. That alerted me to the chemical components of both bread making and bread as a final product. Another point highlighted in the assignment prompt was to look across time and space for similar bread recipes. Thus, I started browsing through several archival and manuscript collections (which is in retrospect is like a rabbit hole) to search for different bread recipes that would come as close to the one used by author-practitioner in 16th century Toulouse. I found some promising titles but all three were 19th-century English recipes.

    After spending quite some time without finding a recipe ( there was one closer to the time of author-practitioner but it turned out to be about bread pudding), I narrowed few recipe books of 16th century that were available via EBBO. However, for some strange reason, there was some technical problem that wouldn't let me log in to the EBBO site. I turned to FAST OCLC and used the authorized keyword search for 'bread." That took me to a worldcat page where I found that the earliest books on bread were grouped together with ale. This made me realize that in this project, perhaps, it is important to think of bread's chemical features as being a criteria for why it was used for moulding purposes.

    Finally, I looked at John Evelyn's recipe but it was not transcribed and I was too lazy to decipher through his writing. At that time, I thought that since I have made roti or chapati which is the Indian flat/round bread. However, for that, I would use baking soda so using sourdough was new to me. I looked up Sauyi Fong's field notes and was relieved to see that she had similar concerns when starting. Since she looked up modern recipes, I followed suit and

    Then I mixed all of it in a steel or steel alloy container that I usually use to knead dough. I am not sure what it is made of. At this point, my goal was to knead it so the consistency was not solid-y enough. So I added flour twice. First was 1/2 a cup and second time was a full cup.

    My sourdough feeding did not work out. There was no bubble so I threw it. My weekend goal is to look up a bread recipe and make it, followed by bread-molding instructions from the manuscript.
   </span>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <span style="font-size: 120%;">
    I decided by looking at the books that I have mentioned above and found out how little I know of bread. Succumbing to force of habit, instead of looking for a recipe and making it, I ended up doing some more readings.
   </span>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <span style="font-size: 120%;">
    By the end of 19th century, it appears that discussion of bread in public sphere came with concerns related to public health. In the two books that I looked at, Bread, Bakehouses and Bacteria (1895) and The Theory and Art of Bread-making, a new process without the use of ferment (1861), the first was written by physicians from London school of Hygiene and Tropical medicine whereas the latter was written by a Harvard Professor. The first book concerned itself with the sanitary conditions of bake-houses which were in ‘cellar-rooms’ lacking proper ventilation. The second book narrated the chemical processes that occurs during bread-making to suggest an alternative of baking using what we now call baking soda.

   <span style="font-size: 120%;">
    The book that I ended up spending more time was the second one. To describe bread, Horsford gave a cellular diagram explaining that there are three layers to bread. First is the brown part, which is usually sifted and then becomes what is called bran. The second is a white part which contains phosphates and nitrogenous gluten and the third is a mass of starch (P5). Thus, it seems that white bread was considered to be of superior quality.

   <span style="font-size: 120%;">
    Surprisingly, I found several references to France that gave me some idea of what ingredients to use in my bread recipe.
   </span>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <span style="font-size: 120%;">
    On P11, he wrote, "Fungus that appears on rye, and its ill-effects, are well-known. The wheat bread distributed among the troops in Paris in 1841 was found to contain in all its crevices a minute red lichen."
   </span>
   <br/>
   <span style="font-size: 120%;">
    Does this give any clue on the kind of bread consumed in mid-19th century France?
   </span>
   <br/>
   <span style="font-size: 120%;">
    On P14, " Process of Rollan which attracted considerable attention in France, and the ingenious processes of Berdan, apply only to the mechanical arrangements connections with kneading and baking."
   </span>
   <br/>
   <span style="font-size: 120%;">
    What is a process of Rollan and Berdan?
   </span>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <span style="font-size: 120%;">
    Finally, there was an interesting passage reflective of social and political thinking of the time.
   </span>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <span style="font-size: 120%;">
    " Pioneers and early settlers owe the prominence to the abundant phosphates supplied by the virgin soil to the cereal and meats that constitute their food. This suggestion derives strength from the circumstance that the effeminacy of many Oriental nationals is the concomitant of a diet which is relatively deficient in Phosphates. (P9).
   </span>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <span style="font-size: 120%;">
    Lastly, I came across this passage in the appendix on how bread was common made in Paris.

     Mold it with the pith of bread just out of the oven, or like that aforementioned, &amp; in drying out it will shrink &amp; consequently so will the medal that you will cast. By these means - lengthening out or enlarging the imprinted bread - you can vary the shape &amp; from one face make several different ones. The bread straight from the oven is best. And the one which has been heated twice contracts more. You can cast sulfur without letting the imprint on the bread dry, if you want to cast it as large as it is. But, if you want to let it shrink, let it dry to a greater or lesser extent.

     Subject: Casting Sulphur and Bee wax into the bread mould
    </span>
   </strong>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   As we began heating the Sulphur in the fume hood, Pamela suggested to use some oil in the bread mould to avoid having the bread sticking to the cast later. I used some linseed oil which I brushed generously on the mould.
   <br/>
   <a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/128418753@N06/38193012052/in/photostream/" rel="nofollow" title="20171002_Dongchung_Breadmoulding_29">

   </a>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   There were several of us sharing the melted Sulphur. We kept the heat at 1.5 and it took us less than 5 minutes to melt the powdered Sulphur into its liquid form. I then poured some into the mould and left it in the fume hood.
   <br/>
   <br/>

   <br/>
   <br/>
   Later, when I took it out after an hour and a half, there was some white coloring that appeared on the cast. I am not sure what it is. This is my Sulphur cast. Some of the bread stuck to the original object and therefore, that part of casting is not clear.

   <br/>
   With the bee wax, we heated the wax outside since it doesn't release any harmful gas. Then, I poured it into another mould. After it dried, I was surprised that the cast was pretty accurate.
