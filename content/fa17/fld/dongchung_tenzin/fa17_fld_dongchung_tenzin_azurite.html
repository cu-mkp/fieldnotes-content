   There were two azurite; one was pure and one had some malachites in it. We took the more expensive one which was easier to beat.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   We then grinded it in mortar and pestle. This was relatively simple as it did not take us a long time.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   As we began mulling it by adding a little bit of water, immediately the powdered azurite relased a distinct scent. The closest smell I could associate it was white chalk that we traditionally use on black or green boards.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   We began bulling on a glass panel. The direction of the mulling was a 8-shaped pattern so that we would use the glass handle and gently press pressure. In this way, the glass pattern's friction further grounds the powder. Initially, the mulling had some grainy sound to it. If we were to grind sand, there is a light screeching that comes from the small coarse surfaces. The mulling sound was similar to this. ( As I am typing this, I realized it sounds similar to how the author-practitioner descripes changes. It didn't occur to me at the time that we have technology to record the sound.) Gradually, over a time length which was longer than expected, the sound changed. Initially, there was some confusion on how long we were supposed to mull. I can't remember who was the original source but it was suggested by an expert that the mulling would be signified as sufficient when we notice a change in the sound of mulling. It was more of an effortless grinding as the powder is more fine. There is no screeching and instead, it had a singing sound that was smooth.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Then we took the small paste in a shell, added some water and swirled it with our hand. Then we sifted it so that the pure blue azurite pigment is found. We repeated the wash several times and left it to dry.

    Subject: Grnding the azurite pigment further
   </strong>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Our mulled azurite in shells have been lying for some time. Today, we took it out of the shells in order to mull it. The purpose was to size the powder evenly. We were advised to differentiate shades or grades of azurite. Based on our collection, there were two main shades. One was darker and a richer blue. It looked like the original azurite stone. The second was lighter, with more white and looks like a diluted form.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   As we used a small palette knife to scrap the pigment, we realized that it was a miniscule amount. Some of the inner linings of the shell also entered into the pigment.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   I took a ceramic plate and added 2 drops of water using a syringe. As I mulled it, the same chalky smell came back.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The problem with the mulling was that the paste would dry very quickly. So we had to keep on adding water.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Finally, we stored our paste in an open plastic container.

   ASPECTS TO KEEP IN MIND WHEN MAKING FIELD NOTES
   <br/>
   <ul>
    <li>
     note time
    </li>
    <li>
     note (changing) conditions in the room
    </li>
    <li>
     note temperature of ingredients to be processed (e.g. cold from fridge, room temperature etc.)
    </li>
    <li>
     document materials, equipment, and processes in writing and with photographs
    </li>
    <li>
     notes on ingredients and equipment (where did you get them? issues of authenticity)
    </li>
    <li>
     note precisely the scales and temperatures you used (please indicate how you interpreted imprecise recipe instruction)
    </li>
