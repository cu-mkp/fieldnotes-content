   . Cut Bread Mold in half
   <br/>
   2. Embed compass into bread half.
   <br/>
   3. Acquire hot plate
   <br/>
   4. Acquire sulfur melting vessel
   <br/>
   5. Acquire powered Sulfur
   <br/>
   6. Acquire ceramic plate
   <br/>
   7. Place implements in the fume hood.
   <br/>
   10. Melt Sulfur on setting 1
   <br/>
   11. Remove compass from the bread mold.
   <br/>
   12. Pour Sulfur into the bread mold.
   <br/>
   Using Bread #2, produced as detailed in my notes on Breadmaking, I attempted to produce a sulfur cast of a compass. I produced the breadmold by cutting the bread in half shortly after baking, pressing the compass into the still hot bread and allowing it to sit for several hours. On reaching the lab, I opened the breadmold and removed the compass carefully. An unpromising looking impression remained behind in the bread. I put on proper PPE, consisting of gloves, safety glasses, and a lab coat. I placed the mold-half of the bread on a ceramic plate and moved on to the preparation of the sulfur. I placed two ceramic plates in the fume hood. I then retrieved powered sulfur and the sulfur melting vessel. I moved a hot plate into the fume hood and placed the sulfur melting vessel on top of it. Finding that the hot plate did not have graded temperature settings, merely arbitrary numbers, I first attempted a 1 heat setting to melt the hardened sulfur remaining in the vessel. When that did not do anything, I increased the heat to 2. Another student in the lab then took over stirring for a couple of minutes. I then took over stirring using a wooden chopstick. The sulfur had become dark and began to smoke--Dr. Smith explained that was problematic and so we took it off the heat and let it cool down until it returned to a yellow-clear, non-smoking state. We then poured the sulfur into the impression left in the breadmold, slowly, making sure to fill the impression entirely. The top turned out slightly irregular, so perhaps I should have poured the sulfur more quickly.

   After letting it sit for two and a half hours, I turned to the extraction of the cast compass. I used dental tools to slowly rip out pieces of the bread from around the sulfur-cast compass and also used the sharp part of the implements to coax the compass out of its hole. It worked relatively easily--I suspect a breadmold must have been appealing because it could be so easily "dug into" to extract the cast object. Once finished, I held a nearly perfect sulfur cast of my compass, except for one small protrusion where a natural cavity in the bread had filled with Sulfur. I sealed the Sulfur compass in a plastic bag with an accompany slip identifying it for future scholars.

   ASPECTS TO KEEP IN MIND WHEN MAKING FIELD NOTES
   <br/>
   <ul>
    <li>
     note time
    </li>
    <li>
     note (changing) conditions in the room
    </li>
    <li>
     note temperature of ingredients to be processed (e.g. cold from fridge, room temperature etc.)
    </li>
    <li>
     document materials, equipment, and processes in writing and with photographs
    </li>
    <li>
     notes on ingredients and equipment (where did you get them? issues of authenticity)
    </li>
    <li>
     note precisely the scales and temperatures you used (please indicate how you interpreted imprecise recipe instruction)
    </li>
    <li>
     see also our
