    Recipe translated into modern day instructions (as we interpreted it):
   </strong>
   <br/>
   If you would like a strong varnish, beat together one egg white with two or three egg yolks. The beating motion should be similar to if you were making an omlette or pancake. If you would like pale varnish, just beat two or three egg yolks with water. If you do not want to use eggs, you can dissolve saffron or marigold flowers in milk for a wash. You could also replace eggs with fish eggs from a Pike or a Jack, if it is Lent. To save on eggs, pastry chefs often use honey. Brush the varnish onto the pastry using a soft brush, made of hogs bristle or silk, or using a feather.
