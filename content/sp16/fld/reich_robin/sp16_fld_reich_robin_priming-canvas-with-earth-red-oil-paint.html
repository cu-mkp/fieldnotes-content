   <ul>
    <li>
     Starting with the prepared canvas (already painted with 2 layers of rabbit skin glue and fully dry), we laid down smooth, medium-thickness layers of earth red oil paint primers
     <ul>
      <li>
       we left a strip of the canvas without the primer to observe the difference (roughly 1")
      </li>
      <li>
       we used both prepared oil paint and paint that we made by mixing pigment powder with linseed oil using a palette knife until it felt smooth and spreadable
       <ul>
        <li>
         we used the prepared paint and the paint we mixed in two separate segments in order to see the difference between the two
         <ul>
          <li>
           Robin spread the paint we mixed on one half of the canvas using a brush in varying directions
           <ul>
            <li>
             she went over one half of that with her fingers, spreading with the straight side of one finger in one smooth motion
             <ul>
              <li>
               this paint required two layers, since the first was partially absorbed into the canvas
              </li>
             </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
             she spread the prepared paint over the other half of the canvas using a palette knife, and then smoothed it with a finger in the same manner
            </li>
           </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
           Sophie spread one half of the canvas with the prepared paint using a brush and smoothing it with a finger, and the other half with the paint we mixed using a palette knife and then smoothing with the length of her finger
          </li>
         </ul>
        </li>
       </ul>
      </li>
     </ul>
