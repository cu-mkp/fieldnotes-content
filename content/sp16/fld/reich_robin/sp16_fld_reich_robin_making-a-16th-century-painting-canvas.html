    Subject: Sewing the canvas
   </strong>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Begin with an approximately 1' square of canvas, a piece of cotton twine that is a few inches longer than the perimeter of the canvas, and a large scrap piece of canvas (a longer strip - at least 8" or so is better, but it can be as narrow as 3").
    </li>
    <li>
     Fold over each edge of the canvas about 3/4"
    </li>
   </ul>
   <img alt="Step 1 - Folding Edge.jpg" src="files/Step%201%20-%20Folding%20Edge.jpg" style="height: 168px; width: 159px;" title="Step 1 - Folding Edge.jpg"/>
   <br/>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Lay the twine against the raw edge and fold again, the same amount - the twine will be sitting inside of a smaller square of canvas, just at the edge. Secure the folds with pins, and leave the tails of the twine hanging (do not tie them).
    </li>
   </ul>
   <img alt="Step 2 - Embedding Twine in Hem.jpg" src="files/Step%202%20-%20Embedding%20Twine%20in%20Hem.jpg" style="height: 172px; width: 163px;" title="Step 2 - Embedding Twine in Hem.jpg"/>
   <br/>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Take the scrap piece of canvas and pull threads from the long side. Start with a good pile of threads.
    </li>
   </ul>
   <img alt="Step 3 - Thread.jpg" src="files/Step%203%20-%20Thread.jpg" style="height: 201px; width: 191px;" title="Step 3 - Thread.jpg"/>
   <br/>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Using the scrap threads, sew down the hem of the canvas using a whip stich
     <ul>
      <li>
       thread the needle, leaving a tail of at least an inch
      </li>
      <li>
       enter the fabric with the hem edge facing you, just below the hem, pushing the needle into the fabric (rather than beginning the stich blindly from the back side)
      </li>
      <li>
       pull the thread through, leaving about 1" of thread, then re-enter the fabric just above the hem edge from the back side
      </li>
      <li>
       pull the thread through until it is taught, but be careful not to pull it so tightly that it breaks
      </li>
      <li>
       take the 1" of thread that you left hanging and lay it along the hem edge - as you sew, wrap your stiches around this thread to secure it
      </li>
      <li>
       when your thread runs out or breaks, thread a new one, twist the tails of the old and new, and continue as before
      </li>
      <li>
       as you move around the canvas, put a few stitches into the corners where the folds overlap, so that they lay flat
      </li>
     </ul>
    </li>
   </ul>

    Subject: Constructing the frame and stretching the canvas
   </strong>
   <br/>
   <ul>
    <li>
     piece together a wooden artist's frame that is slightly larger (2" or so) on each side than your finished canvas
    </li>
    <li>
     cut 4 pieces of twine, each one roughly 10x the length of one side of the canvas
    </li>
    <li>
     using a yarn needle, sew the canvas to the frame, one side at a time
     <ul>
      <li>
       as before, thread the needle with 1" or so of a tail
      </li>
      <li>
       enter the canvas from either side, just below the hem stitches, starting from the corner
      </li>
      <li>
       loop the twine around the top of the frame, leaving at least 1" between the canvas and the frame
      </li>
      <li>
       re-enter the canvas from the other side, no more than 1" from your last entry point, but preferably closer together - roughly 1/3" apart (this is helpful on a smaller canvas to ease the tension on each entry point and to make the stretching more uniform, but on a larger canvas the entry points can be farther apart)
      </li>
      <li>
       when you reach the other corner, remove the needle and knot the tail ends of the twine to the nearest loop
      </li>
      <li>
       repeat on the side across from the first one, so that the canvas will be stretched evenly across the frame - do not worry about the canvas being taught at this stage
      </li>
     </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
     tighten the twine around the edge of the frame by pulling each loop and re-tying the knot at each end, again alternating sides, until the canvas is stretched across the frame with no visible slack and it makes a slight reverberating sound when struck
    </li>
    <li>
     tie the tail ends of the twine that come from inside the canvas to the frame as well - do this securely, but not as tightly as possible
    </li>
    <li>
     trim the tails of the twine
    </li>
   </ul>

    Subject: Priming the Canvas with Rabbit Skin Glue
   </strong>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Heat the rabbit skin glue to between 50 and 55* C in a double boiler or bain marie
     <ul>
      <li>
       make sure not to leave any concentrated or less saturated areas of glue
      </li>
      <li>
       paint in any direction, but after you have laid down the glue layer, go over it again in a different direction
      </li>
     </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
     leave the canvas to dry for 30 minutes in a well-ventilated place, such as a fume hood
    </li>
    <li>
     lay on a second layer of glue as before, and allow to dry again
    </li>
   </ul>
