    This is a well-furbished knife, assembled with a nail in the middle so that it can easily swivel to one side or the other and be hidden, alternately on side A or on side B, inside its handle marked C. The two stops you see on the tips of the knife are used to block it on one side or the other against a nail which is at the butt of the aforesaid handle, so that when one wants to press hard on something in order to cut it, it does not move from the handle. You might as well allow the side marked B to cut, only not during your
    <u>
     performance
    </u>
    , but the side that is notched and marked
    <u>
     A must not be sharp, it should only be furbished.

    And the notch must also be as wide as the edge of a knife so that it cannot hurt.

   <br/>
   <em>
    <span style="font-size: 9pt;">
     And you will only show the part where the knife is not notched, for the side with the notch must be hidden inside the handle. And when you want to cut a nose or a finger, pretend to sharpen your knife on your thigh and at the same time turn it deftly, and the part with the notch, which you will cover with one finger, will come into your hand, and you will place the notch, colored with
     <strong>

    After, make a spectating neighbor drink the rest of the wine or throw it out or leave it to flow through the end, but before that, you must have pressed your thumb well against the hole on the top edge, because in this way, by the compression of air, the wine will be held inside the double wall. Then with a dagger dulled at the tip, pretend that you pierce the forehead of a person who holds a glass in his hand, and while you pierce, you conceal your act with the pipe that you hold close to his forehead, then removing your thumb from on top of the hole on the edge near the top, the air, being free, will make the wine flow out from the double wall through the hole marked B, and fall through the tip marked C into the glass. But you must bend the head of the spectator well in order to do it properly.

    Take a cylindrical ringed vessel carved in wood, as you see, into which you will insert another small vessel that easily fits, as you see in the one marked B, and make it so that it does not touch the bottom of the larger one marked A, but so that there is some distance. Whatever is entering the larger vessel must be , but that the rim is made in a circle so that, being joined, they will appear as if they are the same vessel. You must also have a round cover of &lt;m&gt;leather&lt;/m&gt; of the same length as the vessel, as you see marked C, which will fit easily and surround the aforesaid vessels thusly, placed one within the other. But before you do your trick, you must put &lt;m&gt;gold&lt;/m&gt; or &lt;m&gt;silver&lt;/m&gt; powder or &lt;m&gt;mercury&lt;/m&gt; amalgamed with &lt;m&gt;silver&lt;/m&gt; at the bottom of the larger vessel, and then place the little vessel marked B on top. After, holding the vessel with your index finger on top, present it, and only showing the bottom of the smaller vessel marked B, put a ring or something similar in it. This being done, while placing the vessel on the table, cover it with the leather cap, and making the requisite facial expressions, you will remove the leather cap without showing the interior, and put it on the table and ask them to recall the ring that you placed in the bottom of the smaller vessel marked B. Then, place the leather cover gently back on top and after saying "inhonorificabilitidinitatudinibus," take the outside of the leather cover with two fingers, and squeezing it more firmly than before, then you will lift only the smaller vessel that is inside and contains the ring and you will place both carefully on the table. Then you will pour out the powder or amalgam that is in the bottom of the large vessel, then replace the leather cover with that &lt;sup&gt;vessel&lt;/sup&gt; inside it, as it was at the start. Then, removing the leather cover without removing the smaller vessel, you will show the ring that returned to the bottom &lt;sup&gt;of the vessel&lt;/sup&gt; in its previous state, holding your index finger on the rim of the vessel so that it does not fall out.&lt;/ab&gt;

    Make a small case of plain cow leather or Spanish goat's leather quite thick, as high as three fingers, sewn like the finger of a glove and large enough that two fingertips can fit inside and which, at the tip, is a little creased, and has a round hole as large as a double “ liard.” Take two boxwood balls that look the same, and one should be hollowed and opened by a round hole only on one side so that the thimble can enter. Thus, when you want to perform, you will place your leather case on the table with the ball that is not hollow. Put a stick into the leather case to show that there is nothing inside it, also show the round ball, and hold the hollow one which has the thimble inside it between your little and ring finger, and do this with your right hand with which you hold the stick. After, take the leather case and place it over the hollow ball which is between your fingers and pretend you put some "goldibus" poweder upon it, and replace the leather case that contains the ball on the table, then you take the large round ball remaining on the table, and order it to enter from upon the table into the leather case. Then, lifting the leather, it will seem to be the same, although it is the hollow one. Then, cover it and command that it should become invisible, and lifting the case while pressing it, you will remove it at the same time as the ball, and meanwhile discreetly put it back in the case. In its place will be found a thimble for the ladies whose bottom hurts, that is the bottom of the needle.
