    Starch Glue:
   </h1>
   <ul>
    <li>
     From Cennini's
     <em>
      Libro Dell'Arte
     </em>
     (Chapter CV): "There is a glue which is made from cooked paste which is good for stationers and master book binders. And it is good for gluing pieces of paper to one another and also for sticking tin to paper. Sometimes we need it to glue pieces of paper for doing perforations. This glue is made in the following way: get a little pan almost full of clear water; make it really hot. When it is about to boil, get some thoroughly sieved flour; add it, little by little, to the little pan, stirring continuously with a stick or spoon. Let it boil and make sure that it is not to stiff."

       Seems more like a culinary recipe, not a glue recipe.

       "Colle de farine. (Stationers) past.
       <ul>
        <li>
         A defintion for "farine", also from Cotgrave defines it as "flower". This implimes that "Amydon" was used more to designate flour for eating whereas "farine" was used to indicate flour for glue.
