   2. Distemper, Shadows and Black Pigments
   <br/>
   <br/>
   How could investigating these areas most benefit from laboratory experimentation?
   <br/>
   <strong>
    Distemper
   </strong>
   <br/>
   Following the various instructions for distemper, and perhaps supplementing these through additional research into distemper recipes in other treatises, I could try to paint using a glue-based medium. I could compare my results to extant artworks that are thought to have been made using a glue based medium. If time, I could compare this to painting with other water-based media such as egg, both the understand the differences in handling properties and final results but also because the line between these two techniques seems to have been blurry, and sometimes continues to be so. Perhaps it would be helpful to try to follow the 'distemper' instructions in the manual using first glue, and then again using egg. Perhaps following the recipes will help me to understand how the author is using the word 'distemper' which seems to have multiple possible meanings both in the text and in general usage.
   <br/>
   Comparing these with practical experiments in oil painting might deepen my understanding by providing a further point of comparison. In practical/ experiential terms, do glue-based and egg-based painting have more in common with each other than with oil painting? Is this the same in terms of final appearance? Or is the basis of their being grouped together to do with their solubility in water in contrast to oil painting?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <strong>
    Shadows
   </strong>
   <br/>
   I would be interested in following some of the instructions about painting shadows to see what results can be achieved. Trying out different small paintings of shadows in oil and 'distemper' could be combined with the experiments suggested above to provide experience of both different media and different shadow techniques.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <strong>
    Blacks
   </strong>
   <br/>
   I am very interested in the differences in hue between the following blacks
   <br/>

   </span>
   <br/>
   <span class="s1">
    &lt;ab&gt;Coal black, ordinary black lead black, burnt ivory black, peaches stones black,
   </span>
   <br/>
   <span class="s1">
    black smoke, black light, burnt oxes’ feet bones black&lt;/ab&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
   </span>
   <br/>
   <span class="s1">
    Would it be possible to make some or all of these blacks and compare the tones achieved ?
   </span>
   <br/>
   <span class="s1">
    The reference to 'peaches stones black' is particularly interesting because Cennino Cennino specifically mentions a black made from peach stone. He associates it with one made from almond shells, and differentiates it from blacks made from vine twigs, one made from a 'black soft stone' and a lamp black.
   </span>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <span class="s1">
    I am also very interested in the suggestion of a black made from 'jet'. I would like to find a way to experiment with making a pigment from 'jet'. This will require research to find other sources that indicate more directly how a pigment was made from this.
   </span>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It would also be interesting to combine experimentation with shadows with the question of the tones of different blacks by trying to paint according to these instructions:

    ‘Because blacks produce various colors, some reddish black, others bluish, and others greenish, choose those verging on yellow in order to obtain beautiful shadows in oil, for men’s shadows are similarly yellowish, and for this effect use very strongly crushed … which you mix with a bit of yellow ochre and white lead, that is after you have crushed your white lead and gathered with the (figure) crushed with the … This way it &lt;sup&gt; the black &lt;sup&gt; will be more desiccative, and on its own producing a yellowish black, when mixed with a bit of white it will be perfect for men’s shadows.

    Black clothing was very important in this period, and often the subtle variation between blacks seen in sixteenth century painting focuses on clothing. We might learn something about the gradations of intensity that could be achieved from brown to black.

    Someone who works &lt;add&gt; operates with&lt;/add&gt; &lt;m&gt;oil&lt;/m&gt; will not work properly with &lt;m&gt;distemper&lt;/m&gt; if he has not been trained well during his youth. The manner of working is indeed very different because the brush point always has to be moisten for working with &lt;m&gt;distemper&lt;/m&gt;. While when one cleans the brush in some &lt;m&gt;oil&lt;/m&gt; to soften it, one should dry it well. Otherwise the work would drip and soon be damaged.&lt;/note&gt;

And repeat this two or three times, then make the last layer quite even using a knife, &lt;add&gt;then apply a layer of &lt;m&gt;glue&lt;/m&gt;&lt;/add&gt; upon which you will later be able to put your underlayer and then paint. But make sure that your first white layer is not too thick for it would break easily. Flemish painters have such paintings made by the dozen.&lt;/ab&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;ab&gt;Painting perspectives in &lt;m&gt;oil&lt;/m&gt; takes a long time because of the many lines that need to be drawn with a ruler, and for that reason one generally paints them in distemper. One chooses the &lt;sup&gt;vanishing&lt;/sup&gt; points at will. The main thing is to know &lt;sup&gt;where&lt;/sup&gt; the point is. One commonly sets two or three, sometimes &lt;sup&gt;up to&lt;/sup&gt; five.&lt;/ab&gt;

    'For Tempera Painting (324)
   </span>
   <br/>
   <span class="s1">
    Since paints made with glue, egg white or gum are much darker in the damp state than when they dry, one should, after the canvas has been undercoated, dampen it from behind and paint on it. Thus you will not be deceived.
   </span>
   <br/>
   <span class="s1">
    Also when improving [that is painting over] a tempera picture, dampen the painting from behind, so that the penetrating moisture makes the colors on the canvas appear as they are in pots of shells and the eyes will not be deceived and the improvement will not have unequal places, then paint as you think useful. So the whole work after drying will be equal and in agreement.

    With regard to the liquid for dissolving paints, besides fish glue and glue made of glove leather scraps, egg white thinned with fig juice that the old painters used should be considered. This is stronger or at least as strong as fish glue and always stays fluid.

    Method for Varnishing Illumination. (324a)

    For this a sticky liquid that has body and that is transparent so that it in no way alters the color is necessary above all. This liquid can mainly be very light and clear fish glue boiled to a thicker, stronger consistency. See whether common strong Flemish glue which is clear and light is suitable. Likewise the strong gelatine of stag horn. Likewise gum tragacanth thoroughly dissolved in some distilled water (or if the work is worth it) rose water. Likewise egg white. Likewise gum arabic, plumb resin, cherry tree resin, dissolved into the consistency of syrup, but especially the Arabian gum.

    If one had a very large long haired squirrel tail brush, it could be useful for this, but it would have to be done in one very light motion. I believe the other method of pouring it over is surer.

    A very good strong base is made when gum tragacanth is soften and dissolved a whole night long on warm coals in pure water. Take white starch flour and dissolve it in clear water very thinly, as if it were to be used for laundry starching, to this mixture add your solution of gum tracaganth, and boil it down to the desired consistency, the starch becomes very white and clear, so it makes the laundry very white,. but makes it brittle and spoils it greatly; for our trick its not so and it can perform good service.

    If you want the glue very fluid, than add a little of the above dissolved starch, a lot of the gum tragacanth solution, simply boil it down to the (syrupy thickness) that can easily be stroke on and sticks very hard.’
