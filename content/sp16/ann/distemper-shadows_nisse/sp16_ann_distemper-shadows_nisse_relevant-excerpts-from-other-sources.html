      Since paints made with glue, egg white or gum are much darker in the damp state than when they dry, one should, after the canvas has been undercoated, dampen it from behind and paint on it. Thus you will not be deceived.
     </span>
    </strong>
    <br/>
    <strong>
     <span class="s1">
      Also when improving [that is painting over] a tempera picture, dampen the painting from behind, so that the penetrating moisture makes the colors on the canvas appear as they are in pots of shells and the eyes will not be deceived and the improvement will not have unequal places, then paint as you think useful. So the whole work after drying will be equal and in agreement.

      With regard to the liquid for dissolving paints, besides fish glue and glue made of glove leather scraps, egg white thinned with fig juice that the old painters used should be considered. This is stronger or at least as strong as fish glue and always stays fluid
     </strong>
     .
     <br/>
     Method for Varnishing Illumination. (324a)
     <br/>
     For this a sticky liquid that has body and that is transparent so that it in no way alters the color is necessary above all. This liquid can mainly be very light and clear fish glue boiled to a thicker, stronger consistency. See whether common strong Flemish glue which is clear and light is suitable. Likewise the strong gelatine of stag horn. Likewise gum tragacanth thoroughly dissolved in some distilled water (or if the work is worth it) rose water. Likewise egg white. Likewise gum arabic, plumb resin, cherry tree resin, dissolved into the consistency of syrup, but especially the Arabian gum.
     <br/>
     This liquid is put into a bowl, into a basin or into a tub and the illumination lightly drawn through it, or if the piece is big, it is laid at an angle over a sufficiently large basin and the… (Ms. p.149)
     <br/>
     … liquid is deftly poured over it with a spoon in such a way that the liquid flows over it all at once and then the piece is set immediately on a [table] top and allowed to dry.
     <br/>
     If one had a very large long haired squirrel tail brush, it could be useful for this, but it would have to be done in one very light motion. I believe the other method of pouring it over is surer.
     <br/>
     The well dried piece is painted over with a varnish that be very desiccating like those made without turpentine, with gum, mastic, benzoin purified in ethanol and very light and pure oil of turpentine and spikenard oil.'
     <br/>
     [Base coat of gum Tracacanth] (324b)
     <br/>
     A very good strong base is made when gum tragacanth is soften and dissolved a whole night long on warm coals in pure water. Take white starch flour and dissolve it in clear water very thinly, as if it were to be used for laundry starching, to this mixture add your solution of gum tracaganth, and boil it down to the desired consistency, the starch becomes very white and clear, so it makes the laundry very white,. but makes it brittle and spoils it greatly; for our trick its not so and it can perform good service.
     <br/>
     If you want the glue very fluid, than add a little of the above dissolved starch, a lot of the gum tragacanth solution, simply boil it down to the (syrupy thickness) that can easily be stroke on and sticks very hard.’

    Methods for doing the nude and faces.
   </span>
   <span style="background-color: #ffffff; display: block;">
    After the landscape and the draperies have been somewhat sketched it is appropriate to say something about
    <strong>
     the faces and the nude, which in truth is the main subject of the whole work
    </strong>
    . It is unquestionably true that faces are painted either from imagination or from nature as every visible thing whatsoever is copied from nature. Let us begin with faces that are done from imagination [i.e. fancifully done] of men, women, and even small children. Carnation is usually made with white lead, or peruse with vermillion or lead minimum, or lake, or yellow ocher, as one will have it or
    <strong>
     as the work requires for the masculine, as well as the feminine, flesh tones
    </strong>
    . Shading can be done with one of the following colors:
    <strong>
     yellow ocher, umber earth, or also black, lake or ashpaltum
    </strong>
    . These colors can be mixed with white or carnation paint, made brighter or darker as wished. The hair and beard are done as desired with dark ocher, umber and the like, and when the light of the same is applied and finished, it is lightly touched up here and there as necessary with a little vermillion and lake. To give flesh paint or carnation permanence it is made with white and lake, or vermillion and good ocher; the knees, the face, elbows, hands and feet should be kept somewhat redder than the rest of the body.
   </span>
   <span style="background-color: #ffffff; display: block;">
    The usual light color is heightened with even a stronger light on all things, each according to the illumination thrown by light and shadow.'
    <em>
     There are parallels in the pigments he suggests for shadows, and in the mention of male and female flesh tones. But this does not read like a process of layering from the dark below to the light on top, rather it is oil, and the colours are mixed together.

    'And go little by little with your brush almost dry of this colour, which is called

     verdaccio
    </em>
    in Florence and
    <em>
     bazzeo
    </em>
    in Siena....
    <br/>
    Then get a little thoroughly liquid green earth in another pot and, with a bristle brush which has been half squeezed out between the thumb and forefinger of your left hand, start shading under the chin and more in the part where the face should be darker, going about marking out beneath the lips on the mouth and in the corners of the mouth, beneath the nose and to the side beneath the eyebrows: strongly towards the nose, a little at the end where the eye towards the ear. And go sensitively over the whole face and the hands where there has to be flesh colour in the same way. Then get a pointed vair brush and start thoroughly reinforcing all the outlines, nose, eyes, lips and ears with verdaccio.'
    <br/>
    <em>
     In the original Italian, Cennino uses the verb ‘onbrare’ for the sentence about shading under the chin. Boecke has translated this as ‘shading’.

    When you have mixed the flesh-color pigment and have laid in the faces and nude bodies with it, mix with it prasinus [usually regarded as green earth, but doubts raised in Hawthorne translation who suggests it may be related to the leek-green gem prasitis (Theophrastus) or prasius (Pliny). ], the red that is burnt from ocher, and a little cinnabar, and so make shadow pigment. With this you should delineate the eyebrows and eyes, the nostrils and mouth, the chin, the hollows round the nostrils, the temples, the wrinkles on the forehead and neck, the roundness of the face, the beards of young men, the fingers and toes, and all the distinctive limbs of the nude body.'
