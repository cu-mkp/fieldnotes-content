    the 'recipe' I am following, there is no specific discussion of preparatory sizing or priming. So I have looked elsewhere in the Ms. and to other sources for guidance.

   <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">
    &lt;ab&gt;Apply two or three layers of &lt;m&gt;chalk&lt;/m&gt; distempered with &lt;m&gt;glue&lt;/m&gt; on the painting, not with a paintbrush but with a &lt;sup&gt;large&lt;sup&gt; brush as if you intended to rub it down, and leave to dry. And repeat this two or three times, then make the last layer quite even using a knife, &lt;add&gt;then apply a layer of &lt;m&gt;glue&lt;/m&gt;&lt;/add&gt; upon which you will later be able to put your underlayer and then paint. But make sure that your first white layer is not too thick for it would break easily. Flemish painters have such paintings made by the dozen.&lt;/ab&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    I would like to talk about the French with someone who has better French. What is the repetition of ‘destrempe’ here? Also, one is added to the line in the MS, like an extra/ correction.

    <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">
     This gives instructions for how to do priming layers. Could two or three layers of chalk, distempered with glue, be the appropriate priming for distemper painting on canvas? The idea of it ‘breaking easily’ if too thick, suggests that this could be intended for a canvas painting which would be rolled, or otherwise moved, in which case a thick ground layer would cause cracking.
    </span>
   </em>
   <br/>
   <em>
    <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">
     The context could suggest this is to do with oil painting rather than distemper, as it is close to other discussions of painting in oil
    </span>

    &lt;head&gt;Mid-bright colors&lt;/head&gt;
   </span>
   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">
    &lt;ab&gt;When colors are absorbed into the &lt;m&gt;canvas&lt;/m&gt;, it means that it has been primed only once, and for this reason the colors become matte rather than shiny. But that is best, as long as you retouch it twice, for in this manner, the colors, having more body, will not fade and are much more beautiful, especially &lt;m&gt;azure&lt;/m&gt; and &lt;m&gt;lake&lt;/m&gt; and those that lack body. But those who want to dispatch their painting carelessly prime twice. Thus the colors will not be absorbed, therefore they will not last as long. The second layer of these colors will not be absorbed and will remain shiny.&lt;/ab&gt;
   </span>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <em>
    <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">
     Suggestion seems to be that for canvas, he does not recommend a double ‘priming’. But what is meant by ‘priming’ in his case?
    </span>
   </em>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <em>
    <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">
     I would suggest that the author-practioner’s preoccupation with putting down double layers, and allowing the first layer to sink into the canvas, which he repeats, is for oils primarily. I think this because at p.66r_4 he specifies that he is discussing oil, and repeats similar language about the need to allow colours to sink in, and for the same purpose. His concern is to prevent the fading of colours.

    &lt;head&gt;Colors in &lt;m&gt;oil&lt;/m&gt; that are absorbed&lt;/head&gt;
   </span>
   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">
    &lt;ab&gt;It is best that colors in &lt;m&gt;oil&lt;/m&gt; are absorbed, that is to say they do not remain shiny after they are dry because they do not fade. But if in some places they are shiny, it means that the &lt;m&gt;grease of the oil&lt;/m&gt; has remained in that part which will make the colors fade. The varnish will hold all this together, unite it and make each part resemble the other.&lt;/ab&gt;

    &lt;head&gt;Priming&lt;/head&gt;
   </span>
   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">
    &lt;ab&gt;You must be quite careful about this, and do not do it, as some will, using &lt;m&gt;gold&lt;/m&gt; color made by cleaning the &lt;m&gt;oil&lt;/m&gt; brushes, because &lt;m&gt;verdigris&lt;/m&gt; and other corrosive colors included will end by fading the colors that are laid in after. It is useful to do it with &lt;m&gt;ceruse&lt;/m&gt;, &lt;m&gt;yellow ocher&lt;/m&gt;, and a bit of &lt;m&gt;massicot&lt;/m&gt;,and make it scarcely thick so that it will not crack.&lt;/ab&gt;
   </span>
   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">
    &lt;/div&gt;

   <br/>
   <em>
    <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">
     I think this gives advice for priming of a painting in oils, because it seems to correct earlier advice in the Ms. about making a primer for painting to be done in oil. In 065v_7 the author-pracitioner advises against using pigments from the cleaning of brushes, but at 056V he had said that one can use ‘colors collected from the vessel that is used to clean brushes.’ This seeming contradiction seems most likely to be a correction made to earlier advice on the basis either of experimentation by the author-practitioner, or further observation/ learning about painting practice.

   <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">
    &lt;ab&gt;In order to remove the &lt;m&gt;grease&lt;/m&gt; off &lt;m&gt;marbles&lt;/m&gt;, one crushes &lt;m&gt;ordinary ashes&lt;/m&gt; on it, which afterward are good to make the first primer of a painting to be done in &lt;m&gt;oil&lt;/m&gt; in order to seal the cracks and veins of the &lt;m&gt;wood&lt;/m&gt;. They are thicker than &lt;m&gt;chalk&lt;/m&gt; and are quite greasy. They are mingled with the aforesaid &lt;m&gt;chalk&lt;/m&gt; or with colors collected from the vessel that is used to clean brushes, and they are desiccative and spare the colors. Once this primer coat has been made on the &lt;m&gt;wood&lt;/m&gt;, it is scrubbed with a knife until even. After, one makes a second coat with &lt;m&gt;ceruse&lt;/m&gt; or with the poorest colors mixed together. On an &lt;m&gt;oil&lt;/m&gt; canvas painting one only applies one coat and the mixed &lt;m&gt;ashes&lt;/m&gt; can be used. Also, after crushing a color, one crushes the &lt;m&gt;interior of a large loaf of bread&lt;/m&gt; in order to remove the &lt;m&gt;grease&lt;/m&gt; off the &lt;m&gt;marble&lt;/m&gt;.&lt;/ab&gt;

   </span>
   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">
    &lt;ab&gt;When the priming has been done a long while ago, it becomes greasy. It must be scrubbed with &lt;m&gt;ashes&lt;/m&gt; and &lt;m&gt;water&lt;/m&gt;.&lt;/ab&gt;
   </span>
   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">
    In 93v itself, the author-practitioner neither mentions a priming layer nor a size layer. This must be tacit knowledge, or available somewhere else in the Ms.

   Chalk
   <br/>
   "croye"
   <br/>
   Cotgrave 'Croye: f. Chalke.'
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Susie Nash, Burgundian Courts.
   <br/>
   Chalk used by the Burgundian courts for painters’ use. It is described as being used for preparing grounds on the altarpieces and for the monk’s walls.
   <br/>
   “At Champmol, chalk was also used as a ground layer over stone before it was painted: it is evident in most of the samples from the Great Cross, where it is found under the lead white or ochre priming/colouring layers.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   See info on googledoc about champagne chalk.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Glue
   <br/>
   "Colle de destrempe"
   <br/>
   Cotgrave 'Colle: f. Glue; also, solder; also the unprofitable corners of hides, and skinnes, cut off in the dressing'.
   <br/>
   Hide glue might be the most appropriate translation then?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Also from Nash Burgundian Courts:
   <br/>
   “This was to be mixed with glue made from the six
   <em>
    benas- tons
   </em>
   (baskets) of parchment clippings ‘a faire cole, pour coler lesdites tables et tableaux’ supplied with the chalk (Table 2, no. 32), and applied over the 64
   <em>
    aulnes
   </em>
   of cloth (
   <em>
    ne toile de lin
   </em>
   ) supplied for lining the panels by Gillote, wife of Phillipe Arnault and sister-in-law to Amiot Arnault, the receiver general whom we met supplying ultramarine, above (Table 2, no. 28).”

    We painted on a panel that had first been primed with gesso, and then given a layer of rabbit skin glue.
   </span>
   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">
    I understood the rabbit skin glue layer to be the preparation required for painting in distemper thereafter.

    Dr Erma Hermens Lecture - in Tuchlein painting we do not see a thick ground layer. That was developed later in canvas painting. The canvas weave remains visible. The surface is matte and powdery.

   <br/>

    ‘The canvases that have been pre-prepared for working in distemper have a very thin glue and chalk isolation layer.’

   <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">
    In discussing Netherlandish Tuchlein technique: ‘There was usually no ground preparation applied, but instead a glue size, that was sometimes toned. The painting medium was distemper, which is a catch-all term used to refer to pigments bound in a water-based medium, sometimes gum or egg white, but most often animal glue. This lean paint resulted in a matte surface, with the texture of the fabric remaining very evident.’… ‘The varied state of preservation of fifteenth and sixteenth-century tuchleins, combined with the small number of surviving examples, has long complicated comprehensive technical studies.’ p4

     Conclusion for experiment
    </span>
   </strong>
   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">
    For my first experiment, I am going to take the author-practitioner to mean a glue-based medium for distemper painting.
   </span>
   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">
    I will follow the instructions in the Ms at 60r_1 and apply 2-3 thin layer of glue and chalk mixed, followed by a layer of glue only. Would this make it difficult for the dampness of the sponge to come through to the surface to aid with painting as instructed in 93v? I do not think so. Would it prevent the bistre from ‘staining’ the canvas? I am unsure about this.
