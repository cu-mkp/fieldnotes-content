 <strong>Location: Making and Knowing Lab / My apartment (58thSt)</strong><br />
<strong>Subject: Sewing the linen, lacing around the canvas</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>I started by tacking down a hem of c.2cm around the circumference of the linen, and then placed a strip of cotton twine inside the hem to reinforce the edges. I then fell stitched the hems down, ensuring that the cotton twine was at the edge of the square of linen, using a sewing needle and linen thread taken from the edge of a scrap of the linen.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>I assembled the wooden canvas frame.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Then I used a yarn needle to lace cotton twine around the wooden canvas, and into the linen, just below the line of hem stitches. I then tightened the twine so that the tension was like that of a slightly loose drum.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Thoughts and responses: it was hard to get the tension right, to anticipate the effect that rabbit skin glue would have on the tightness of the linen, and so I made sure that the twine was adjustable.</strong><br />

 <strong>Location: Making and Knowing Lab</strong><br />
<strong>Subject: Painting on the Rabbit Skin Glue</strong><br />
<strong>Temperature: 4*c outdoors, temperature in the lab c.24*c indoors (fluctuating as the window was open)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The rabbit skin glue was heated to a temperature of 55*c and mixed at a</strong> <strong>1:10 ratio of glue to water.</strong><br />
<strong>Making sure the glue had dissolved into the water, I applied the glue with a soft brush in a vertical direction, onto the linen (below the hem line).</strong><br />
<strong>I then set it to dry for c.1 hour in the fume hood, where there would be increased airflow.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>After c.1 hour I applied a second layer of rabbit skin glue and set it to dry again in the fume hood.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Thoughts and responses:It strikes me that this preparation is very similar to the experiments I have been doing with making early modern clothing. When I made a small doublet, I painted linen canvas with rabbit skin glue to stiffen it as a lining for the laps (skirt around the bottom of the doublet), belly piece and shoulder wings. I did not realise that there was such a cross over of techniques and materials as a prepatory stage in both tailoring and painting until now, and I also did not realise that the wooden frame was sometimes called the loom. I am fascinated by the shared materials, techniques, and language of artisans in this period, and this connection was striking.</strong><br />
