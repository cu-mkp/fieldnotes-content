    I am currently studying at St. John's College,

    . My research, funded by the AHRC and supervised by Ulinka Rublack, explores the culture and making of clothing in early modern London (c.1560-1660). I work with extant objects as well as archival, visual and literary sources and have been reconstructing tailoring, pattern drafting, leather working, starching and seamstress practices. I am particularly interested in the interrelationship between material and literary culture with regards to clothing in Elizabethan and Jacobean England, reconstruction, materiality, craft, consumption, sumptuary law, and the history of emotions.

    From January - May 2016, I am a Visiting Scholar at Columbia University, sponsored by Professor Pamela Smith and the Center for Science and Society. I am particularly interested in reconstruction as a methodology for learning about craft practices, materials, and tacit knowledge.
