   Robin Reich is a PhD student in the Department of History. She studies interactions between Christians and Muslims in Sicily and North Africa during the twelfth century, through the exchange of medical texts, disease and medical practice, trade, and architecture and crafts. Recently, she has researched the transmission of medical practice through texts and their translation, the relationship between the qualities of materials and their application, and the use of iconography in identity politics. Her aim is to add to our understanding of how individuals and groups related to one another in the pre-modern world. She received her BA in History from Carleton College in 2012, with minors in Medieval and Renaissance Studies and Archaeology. She received her MA in History from Boston College in 2015 with foci in Medieval Mediterranean and Medieval Islam.
