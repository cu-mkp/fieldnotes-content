There is a lot of information from other parts of the Ms that are relevant to these recipes.<br />
093v is in the context of a variety of different material. On p.93r there are instructions about keeping olives, country folks' observations, and sand for molding. The page 93c begins with this recipe, with the heading 'Visaige a destrempe'. It is neatly written in the centre of the page. Below is a recipe for 'Azur' which suggests that it ought to be used on canvas, better than on wood. Perhaps a connection between these could be the references to painting on canvas?<br />
<br />
065r _1 is in the context of a great deal of discussion of painting. Beginning at approximately p.57, the author-practitioner gives a lot of information about different painting materials and techniques. This is the part of the Ms. that most resembles a 'painting manual.' I will use many of these for my reconstructions if I find I need additional information through the process.
