Directly above 066r_2 is a recipe directing how many layers of colour to put down. 066r_1 reads as follows: ‘Double coats/ The Flemish and others who make paintings by the dozen apply one coat and finish in the first go.

 <h5 id="toc11"><a name="x----It seems most likely that this combination of pigments were intended to be used for the shadows of women in oil, rather than distemper. I think this partly because the author-practitioner is specific at 065r_1 in a selection of pigments that are ‘perfect’ for the shadows of a woman’s flesh tones in distemper. 065r_1 is just the page before 066r_2 and they are both contained within the section of the manuscript between pages 57 and 67 where recipes for painting techniques cluster. Trying this combination of pigments in oil also offers the opportunity to directly compare my recent experience of handling glue-based paint to create shadows with the very different medium of oil."></a><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> It seems most likely that this combination of pigments were intended to be used for the shadows of women in oil, rather than distemper.

 <br />
<u>Protocol for combining these and painting them out in oil</u>:<br />
Take umber (see my notes on umber, extensive), asphalt (see notes, which I need to update with further research) and red lake (madder lake available in studio).<br />
Combine them, and grind them together with some linseed oil.<br />
Paint this out on one of the pre-prepared white boards, sealed with oil.<br />
See what colour this creates.<br />
Compare how it feels to paint in oil with me recent experience of painting with distemper.<br />
<br />
In terms of safety, none of the pigments used are hazardous according to MSDS information.<br />
However this advice is given for first aid measures for asphaltum pigment by the supplier (Kremer):<br />
<u>Asphaltum Pigment General information: CAS No. 12002-43-6 EINECS: 310-127-6</u><br />
First Aid Measures<br />
After inhalation: Supply fresh air. If required give artificial respiration.<br />
After skin contact: Wash with soap and rinse with plenty of water. Remove contaminated clothing.<br />
After eye contact: Rinse open eyes with plenty of water. In case of discomfort seek medical help.<br />
After ingestion: In case of complaints consult a physician. Rinse mouth with plenty of water. No special measures required.<br />
Most Important Symptoms and Effects, both Acute and Delayed Possible symptoms: Cough, nausea.<br />
Special hazard - In case of fire: formation of carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen oxides (NOx).<br />
Firefighters are advised to wear special protective equipment.<br />
Extinguishing media for the surrounding fire - none are considered unsuitable.<br />
Accidental Release Measures<br />
In case of fire: formation of carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). Wear self-contained respiratory protective device and full protective gear.<br />
Personal Precautions, Protective Equipment and Emergency Procedures<br />
Personal precautions:Wear protective clothing.<br />
Environmental precautions:<br />
Methods and material for containment and cleaning up: Prevent contamination of soil, drains and surface waters. Take up mechanically and collect in suitable containers for disposal.<br />
<br />
Handling and Storage<br />
Precautions for Safe Handling<br />
Instructions on safe handling:Avoid formation of dust.<br />
Information on fire and explosion protection:Keep away from sources of ignition - do not smoke. Take measures to prevent electricity static discharge.<br />
Conditions for Safe Storage, including any Incompatibilities<br />
Storage conditions: Store in tightly sealed containers in a cool and well ventilated location.<br />
Requirements for storage areas and containers: No special measures necessary.<br />
Storage compatibility: No special measures required.<br />
<br />
<strong>In summary - store in well sealed containers. Observe usual best practice in the laboratory for example wearing protective clothing, n smoking, clean up thoroughly.</strong><br />
<strong>While there is no significant hazard for either madder lake pigment or umber pigment either, following the above instructions will also maintain safe working practices with those substances.</strong><br />
