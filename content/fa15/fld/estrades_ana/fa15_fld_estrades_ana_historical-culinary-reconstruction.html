       What were "French Puffs"? In our contemporary minds, we assumed this meant SWEET puff pastries (in fact, modern "vintage french puffs" are just sweet (see source link below) Also, we did not find a similar recipe in any contemporary book, though there are English recipes to make pies in the 17th century that used same herbs and ingredients, but no lemons.

      The author Robert May was a cook for the nobility and had 55 years of experience- thus “the accomplisht cook.” This might explain the lack of detailed quantities and directions in the recipe (though not uncommon in contemporary recipe books, as seen in class presentations) Thus, we had issues on
      <span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">
       how generous should we be in our use of spices and how to interpret vague instructions.

     <span style="background-color: #ffffff;">
      <span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">
       How would this dish be served in a meal? Appetizer, side dish, other? It is not specified in May's book

    BUYING INGREDIENTS:

   <ul>
    <li>
     <span style="background-color: #ffffff;">
      <span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">
       Bought ingredients at Whole Foods, most listed ingredients are herbs/spices that are currently still being used today

    </li>
    <li>
     <span style="background-color: #ffffff;">
      <span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">
       Based on how the ingredients were grouped in the recipe, we believed the spinach, thyme, parsley, endive, savory, and marjoram were to be used fresh herbs and the nutmeg, ginger, cinnamon dried, as spices
      </span>
     </span>

     <span style="background-color: #ffffff;">
      <span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">
       Interesting to note that dried and powdered nutmeg, ginger, and cinnamon are still from Sri Lanka and Indonesia, a similar area of the world that was exporting these spices to England around 1671 (referenced in Keay, John. The spice route: a history. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2006.)

      <span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">
       We bought ghee, because we only learned after buying how to easily make our own ghee by heating and then filtering regular butter
      </span>

     <span style="background-color: #ffffff;">
      <span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">
       The only quantity given, 20 eggs, was rather large, so we decided to half it. This quantity though is again key to May's cooking for a wealthy household.

      <span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">
       While we bought an inexpensive wine, given the little quantity needed, we spent some time discussing with the wine vendor the aprox. kind of wine we needed. Claret is a red wine from the Bordeaux region (Echikson, William. Noble Rot: A Bordeaux Wine Revolution. NY: Norton, 2004.)

    CONCLUDING THOUGHTS
   </span>
   <br/>
   <ul>
    <li>
     <span style="background-color: #ffffff;">
      <span style="line-height: 1.5;">
       Time consuming recipe: fresh herbs that needed to be cleaned and chopped; especially frying was time consuming, difficulty of getting batter to stick to lemons
      </span>
     </span>
    </li>
    <li>
     <span style="background-color: #ffffff;">
      <span style="line-height: 1.5;">
       More directions and quantities were needed: First time using clarified butter (right heat?), the lemon rinds cooked much more quickly than expected
      </span>
     </span>
    </li>
    <li>
     <span style="background-color: #ffffff;">
      <span style="line-height: 1.5;">
       Unexpected taste:
      </span>
      <span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">
       lemon was dominant flavor; not strongly sweet or savory and no single spice or herb dominates. Based on this flavor, it is difficult for us to discern the type of dish it would have been at the time. We certainly learned that taste in the 17th century was very different to ours today
