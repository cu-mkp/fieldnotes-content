    To Make Quince Jelly of Exceptional Beauty, Goodness, Flavor, &amp; Excellence, Proper to Present before a King, &amp; Which Keeps a Long Time.

   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14.666666666666666px; vertical-align: baseline;">
    From Michel de Nostredame, Excellent et moult utile opuscule à touts nécessaire qui désirent avoir cognoissance de plusieurs exquises recettes (Lyon, 1552; recipe from 1555): Take whatever quince you wish, above all they should be very ripe &amp; yellow, &amp; quarter them, without peeling them (those who trim them, or peel them do not understand what they are doing: for the peel increases their perfume) &amp; cut each quince into five or six pieces: and remove the seeds, because they will jell well without them: &amp; while you cut them, put them in a bowl full of water, because if they are chopped or cut hurriedly, without being soaked in water, they will turn black: &amp; when they are chopped, boil them in a large quantity of water, until they are thoroughly cooked, almost crumbling: &amp; then when they are well done, strain this water through a fresh cloth, which should be thick, &amp; extract as much of this decoction as possible by squeezing hard: &amp; then measure it: &amp; if there are six pounds, you take a pound and a half of Madeira sugar, and stir it into the decoction, &amp; boil it over what you judge to be a medium heat, so that toward the end it will reduce a great deal: &amp; then lower the heat so it does not scorch at the sides, which would give bad color to the jelly: &amp; then when it is nearly cooked, to recognize when it is perfectly cooked, you take a little with a spatula, or a silver spoon, &amp; put it onto a dish: &amp; if you see when it is cold that the drop holds quite round without spreading, the jelly is done, &amp; take it from the fire: &amp; wait until the foam on top subsides: &amp; when still hot you put it in boxes of wood, or glass: &amp; if you want to write something, or shape the bottom of the box, you can do it, because it can easily be seen: for the color will be transparent, resembling an oriental ruby, of similar excellent color, &amp; flavor even greater, this jelly can be given to invalids, and to the healthy.

   <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14.666666666666666px; vertical-align: baseline;">
    1. How should we interpret/ gauge “thickness” re: cloth specifications? High heat low heat? Fresh cloth as in clean or freshly woven? Does thick refer to one thick cloth or layers of thinner fabric?

   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14.666666666666666px; vertical-align: baseline;">
    2. Madeira sugar – can we interpret this as a (burnt sugar) syrup or molasses?

   TRIAL 1

   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14.666666666666666px; vertical-align: baseline;">
    Environmental notes: Morning, kitchen is well lit (natural light); small fan; open window; slightly warm room temperature
   </span>
   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14.666666666666666px; vertical-align: baseline;">
    3 quinces (from California) total weight: 2lbs and 7/8 oz.; weighed in wooden bowl
   </span>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14.666666666666666px; vertical-align: baseline;">
    Note that quinces are not as ripe as recipe calls for - they are almost totally green rather than “very ripe &amp; yellow” as suggested.
   </span>
   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14.666666666666666px; vertical-align: baseline;">
    Estimating to use between .5 and .75 pounds of sugar based on recipe measurement of 6lbs of quince to 1.5 lbs of sugar. We have decided to use brown sugar (Domino brand). The final weight of brown sugar to be used: 11 ¾ ounces of brown sugar.
   </span>
   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14.666666666666666px; vertical-align: baseline;">
    Filling wooden bowl with cold water in which cut quinces will soak – recipe does not specify water temperature for soaking
   </span>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14.666666666666666px; vertical-align: baseline;">
    Halved each quince before cutting each half into 5 or six pieces (widthwise). Careful not to “trim” the quinces but with our fingers removed seeds, the area around which left an oily residue on our fingers.
   </span>
   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14.666666666666666px; vertical-align: baseline;">
    Texture of quinces after cutting and quartering and removing of seeds is comparable to eggplant re: spongy but hard, not heavy but seemingly dense, however not absorbent; slight browning near cut edges and areas in which seeds were removed; some yellowing similar to an apple
   </span>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14.666666666666666px; vertical-align: baseline;">
    Added cut quinces to wooden bowl with water. Disposed of seeds and discarded material. Aroma of soaking quinces is like apple but more floral while uncut unsoaked quinces were less aromatic (smelled like unripe, young fruit). Removed black bits (of flower?) naturally loosening from fruit and floating to top. (10:53AM) After about ten minutes of soaking in the uncovered wooden bowl, the quinces are increasingly fragrant and seem to be absorbing water – they are more supple to the touch. We are periodically fondling the quinces to get them in the water (as they had been floating) before sinking a bit by 10:54AM. Removed cut quinces from soaking bath into separate bowl to transfer fruit to boiling water – note moments when quinces were out of water to be transferred to pot. The quinces’s soaking water, photographed after their removal, is cloudier than regular water.
   </span>
   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14.666666666666666px; vertical-align: baseline;">
    Boiling cut quinces in stainless steel pot that is an eight quart vessel the bottom of which has been stained through cooking Indian food with turmeric in it – color of pot is slightly yellowish – 4.5 quarts of water to accommodate ambiguity of “large quantity of water”; covered pot with boiling water to boil faster
   </span>
   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14.666666666666666px; vertical-align: baseline;">
    Added quinces to pot of boiling water at 11:04AM. Had intended to weigh the soaked cut quinces but forgot. Stirring mixture periodically with wooden spoon. All cut quinces look uniformly yellow – difficult to distinguish between peel and flesh for some; one of the pieces of quince still with seed had a seed that had swelled to the size of an apple seed. Aroma at 11:14AM is less like turmeric, smells slightly savory – somewhere between cooking applesauce and fresh tomatoes. Quinces appear to be getting smaller at 11:16AM and softening at 11:18AM such that impression even tear is made with gentle prodding of wooden spoon. At 11:48AM, the quinces are slightly yellower, potato-like in consistency, no evidence of pink color we anticipated with regard to supposed ruby-like color of final product. At 11:58AM the quince still appear yellow, peel and flesh are virtually indistinguishable, although there is evidence of some reddening of the fruit. At 12:13PM the fruit is pinker, still holding its shape, and quite soft such that we can cut through them with the wooden spoon; the water has significantly reduced in amount. At 12:31PM, the fruit is softer in texture (felt with wooden spoon) and more uniformly peach colored. Turned off heat at 12:36PM; pot stain seemingly absorbed by mixture (no longer evident in pot).

   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14.666666666666666px; vertical-align: baseline;">
    Straining boiled quince in what we deem to be “fresh” as in clean relatively thick white cloth. Squeezing above the fruit (wearing oven mitts) into a colander letting liquid drain. Draining liquid is sweet smelling, peachy in color. Left “flower” elements in fruit.
   </span>
   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14.666666666666666px; vertical-align: baseline;">
    Upon inspection after removing quinces, the soaking water had slight fragrance of quince – water feels silky, almost thinner than water, with a matte finish; cloth seems to be of adequate thickness.
   </span>
   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14.666666666666666px; vertical-align: baseline;">
    Weighing fruit in a small bowl (out of cloth) to get a sense of change if any. Fruit smells like sweet potatoes, no evidence of turmeric, still fragrant but more savory. Weighs 1lb 6.5 ounces.
   </span>
   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14.666666666666666px; vertical-align: baseline;">
    Using same pot to reduce mixture with sugar – scrubbed pot clean with soap and water between boiling and reduction
   </span>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14.666666666666666px; vertical-align: baseline;">
    Putting stove on medium heat (medium heat on this gas stove tends to be quite high, on “2” of “10”, we are judging that to be medium heat)
   </span>
   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14.666666666666666px; vertical-align: baseline;">
    Put boiled quinces into pot, slowly stirring in brown sugar at 12:48PM. The tiniest bit of brown sugar has drastically changed the fragrance – we know we have too much brown sugar – now a very strong brown sugar smell, smells complementary to quinces. Guessing that final results will be brown in color. Mixture looks pecan-pie brown in color smells like molasses. Choosing not to stir the mixture because the recipe does not call for stirring at this stage in the reduction. The mixture is bubbling at 12:56PM. Still resisting the urge to stir despite slight stirring with wooden spoon. Guessing that a brown sugar syrup (brown sugar and water) will achieve a more uniform texture to combat the present clumpiness of mixture. Estimating that we are using about 100-200 more grams of sugar than necessary. The smell is overwhelmingly of brown sugar and the mixture is steadily bubbling, feels like it’s sticking – making the executive decision to stir occasionally. Mixture is shiny at 1:13PM, smells like prunes – very intoxicating, moves through nose onto tongue – desirous to eat – fragrance is seductive, also want to taste it, luscious, savory sweet – not saccharine, syrupy, not tight crisp sweet, seems like a nice fall/winter dish even if eaten cold based on smell and color which is quite brown. Natural impulse at 1:22PM to add water perhaps because if we put less sugar, waters of fruit would have mixed more with sugar, is presently chunky/ lumpy. Mixture is sticking a bit at 1:24PM, resumed stirring, want to reduce heat because mixture is sticking but would not call mixture greatly reduced – perhaps because there is too much sugar compared to the amount of fruit. When picked up with spoon to test consistency we found the mixture to be sticky, thick, weighty, and caramelized in both smell and color. At 1:29PM, the mixture has become quite fibrous, very stringy, clumpy in parts, can see the peel is separating from the flesh such that it is fully detachable, plastic-like, and sticky. Tasted mixture at 1:32PM – tastes sugary, could see how it may have been medicinal for the throat like a lozenge. Reducing heat at 1:32PM to as low as the stove goes (which is still higher than most burners). Mixture still looks like pecan pie but with pieces of peachy colored quince – looks like pie filling which is of note in that there are many recipes for quince pie. Quince pieces have reduced in size.

    PAUSING EXPERIMENT AT 1:38PM, will resume in the evening
   </span>
   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14.666666666666666px; vertical-align: baseline;">
    We are leaving the mixture in the pot off heat with a cover.

   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14.666666666666666px; vertical-align: baseline;">
    RESUMING EXPERIMENT AT 8:15pm
   </span>
   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14.666666666666666px; vertical-align: baseline;">
    The aroma has really strengthened over the past hours. There is almost no distinction between this smell and that of a box of prunes. It is still very thick and fibrous. The mixture is very dense and it is hard to imagine that this mixture could ever become transparent. It looks nothing like a ruby and I would not describe the color as excellent.
   </span>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14.666666666666666px; vertical-align: baseline;">
    At 8:55PM, after 40 minutes of cooking over low heat (“lo” setting on stove...lowest possible setting), there is little apparent change in the quince “jelly.” Some of the chunkier bits are gone due to all the stirring I keep doing to keep it from sticking to the pan and burning. It’s possible the color has gotten a bit darker. It is the consistency of a thick paste.
   </span>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14.666666666666666px; vertical-align: baseline;">
    At 8:58PM the mixture is sticking heavily to the pot so removing from heat and placing in a glass container. Container to be covered with red plastic lid so bugs aren’t attracted to it. Will not be refrigerated as recipe suggests that it keeps well.

   <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14.666666666666666px; vertical-align: baseline;">
    Siddhartha’s curiosity about the term “Madeira sugar” led to research on specification of “Madeira.” Found that madeira sugar could refer to a syrup or honey (see:

    ). Our first attempt left our final concoction quite lumpy and far from transparent. In that process, we wondered if the granular consistency of the brown sugar we were using might make it more difficult to end up with a transparent finished product. The thought then crossed Siddhartha’s mind to turn the brown sugar into a syrup--more like some of the modern-day “Madeira sugar” products available that seem quite identified with the area (like Madeira wine). We found research suggesting that in the sixteenth century, 10% of Madeira’s inhabitants were slaves operating the sugar industry. It would also be possible to turn madeira into a syrup, Siddhartha thought, by reducing the wine or adding sugar--this would certainly add to the redness and ruby-like quality of the color. Still unsure however if ‘Madeira’ (the wine) was called the same thing at the time of the recipe.

    We will try to make a syrup using a 2 : 1 ratio, sugar : water, based on previous cooking experience.

    Using the remainder of the Domino brand “dark brown sugar” from yesterday and supplementing with Krasdale brand “dark brown sugar” to attempt sugar syrup at 7:07AM. The color and consistency of Krasdale brown sugar is completely indistinguishable from Domino brown sugar. Approximately half of the 1.5 cups of sugar used is Domino (0.75 cups) and half is Krasdale (0.75 cups). In Trial 1, we mistakenly weighed the quince before boiling as opposed to after, as the recipe calls for, to calculate necessary amount of sugar. Based on our miscalculation in Trial 1, we are assuming that this amount (1.5 cups of sugar) will be more than enough. If the amount falls short, we should be able to make more syrup before adding it to the boiled quince later this afternoon when we reconvene. Sugar weighs 6 lbs ¼ oz. Begin by trying to melt (slowly/gently over medium heat) the brown sugar while water is boiling separately to add later. At 7:27AM, doubting whether this process will work -- sugar is not melting down yet as we had hoped but also not burning. At 7:31AM, adding a bit of water which seems to help. At 7:33AM, quickly added (approximately .75 cups) of water.

    Halved three quinces, cut each half into five-six pieces (removed seeds and “flower”), and soaking in water at 12:36PM; fondling the pieces and removing tough bits (around the core mostly) that are easy to remove since our first attempt was nowhere near transparent and very chunky; same slimy residue/ silky quality from core parts.

    Begin boiling 2 quarts of water (we are experimenting with less water) in same pot as yesterday (with little to no tumeric evident). Put chopped quince in boiling water at 12:48PM. Smell in boiling water lacks tomato masala-like smell of yesterday. Notice presence of foam at 1:03PM. Quinces are starting to crumble at 1:35PM. Mixture is less pink today than yesterday which is perhaps good because the sugar will make it less brown and more red?

    Stirring in sugar syrup to large pot with boiled quince over what we judge to be a medium heat (“3” of “10”) at 1:46PM. The syrup sugar agent is seemingly more successful from the outset. The aroma is far less pruney and much more quincey - you can see how the brown sugar and the fruit will complement each other; smells like sugar is bringing out the fruit, very fragrant. At 2:06PM smells like autumnal applesauce; congealing to be more puree-like but also fibrous. At 2:13PM, quinces are more golden in color, very fragrant. At 2:21PM reducing a bit; not sticking to pot. Estimating finish time around 2:45PM. At 2:41PM reducing to lowest heat setting (some of the fibrous bits started sticking). At 2:57PM more puree-like, not transparent - more puree than compote. At 3:14PM if we were to write something on the bottom of the container, it would be invisible, unlike transparency advertised in recipe.

    Siddhartha: I am about to make a 3rd attempt at the recipe with a few modifications based on our experience the previous two times to see if the results change. The first significant change is that I plan to adjust the heat, having discussed with my partner the potential differences between “high heat” in the 16th century and “high heat” today. As we are working with a gas burner that sends a constant stream of heat rather than burning wood, coal, or manure, I intend to cook the quinces over medium/medium-high heat to see if there is any difference in color. The second significant change is that I am going to interpret “madeira sugar” as a syrup composed of a sweet red wine, as no attempt thus far has yielded a finished product that is anywhere near the color of a ruby. In lieu of madeira, I will use port which is another sweet wine from Portugal. The recipe seems to emphasize the color of the quince jelly over its flavor. We have a rather firm understanding of the flavor of quince and quince jelly from our previous two experiments. In this third attempt, I will try to get closer to the color described in the original recipe.

   <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14.666666666666666px; vertical-align: baseline;">
    I am using a cast iron vessel on this 3rd attempt. I have not yet done research on the kinds of metals used in pots and pans in the 16th century, but I am assuming they were not using stainless steel. Given that cast iron holds heat well, this should be an interesting attempt--to set the flame at “medium” heat and interpret that as “high heat” in the 1555. Note that the cast iron vessel I am using has been previously used as a dutch oven for baking. My friend who owns it suggests thoroughly scrubbing it to remove any oil residue.

   <strong>
    The best way to Preserve Quinces.
   </strong>
   <br/>
   FIrst pare and coare the
   <em>
    Quinces,
   </em>
   and boyle them in faire water till they be very tender, not covering them, then taking them out of the water, take to every pound of them, two pound of
   <em>
    Su|gar,
   </em>
   and half a pint of water, boyle it to a Syrupe, scumming it well, then put in some of the Jelly that is washed from the
   <em>
    Quince
   </em>
   ker|nels, and after that, making it boyle a little, put in your
   <em>
    Quinces,
   </em>
   boyle them very fast, keeping the holes upward as neer as you can, for fear of breaking, and when they are so tender that you may thrust a rush through them, take them off, and put them up in your glasses, having first saved some Syrupe till it be cold to fill up your glasses.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <strong>
    A speciall Remembrance in doing them.
   </strong>
   <br/>
   When you Preserve
   <em>
    Quinces,
   </em>
   or make
   <em>
    Marmalade,
   </em>
   take the Ker|nels out of the raw
   <em>
    Quinces,
   </em>
   and wash off the Jelly that groweth about them, in faire water, then straine the water and Jelly from the kernels, through some fine Cobweb laune, and put the same into the
   <em>
    Marmalade,
   </em>
   or preserved
   <em>
    Quinces,
   </em>
   when they are well scum'd, but put not so much into your
   <em>
    Quinces,
   </em>
   as into the
   <em>
    Mar|malade,
   </em>
   for it will Jelly the Syrupe too much; put six or seven spoonfulls of Syrupe into the Jelly. Before you put it into the
   <em>
    Marmalade,
   </em>
   you must boyle your
   <em>
    Quinces
   </em>
   more for
   <em>
    Marmalade,
   </em>
   then to preserve your
   <em>
    Quinces,
   </em>
   and least of them when you make your clear Cakes.
   <br/>
   When you would preserve your
   <em>
    Quinces
   </em>
   white, you must not cover them in the boyling, and you must put halfe as much
   <em>
    Sugar
   </em>
   more for the white, as for the other. When you would have them red, you must cover them in the boyling.

   <br/>
   Parsly, Lettice, Sorrell, Endive, Succorie, Sperage, Hop|buds, Burnet, Burrage, Buglosse, Thime, Mints, Hysop, but in Winter, Balm, Bittanie, Thime, Marigold, Hysop, Majoram, Mints and Rue are good. For your Sallets take Pimpernell, Purslane, Mints, Sorrell, Hore-hound, Yong cole, Hop-buds, Sperage, Thime, Tops of Fennell, Tarregon, Lettice, and Wa|ter-cresses are good.
   <br/>
   Capers are greatly commended being preserved in Vinegar, and eaten with a little oyle and vinegar, and so are Olives very good also.

   For your sauce, the juyce of a Limon, Citron, or Orange is best, the juyce of Sorrell and Vinegar is also good.

   All raw fruits are to be refused, except those which tend to sour tast, as Pomgranates, damask Prunes, Pippins, red and sour Cherries, and Wallnuts,

    Halve three quinces; cut each half into five or six slices lengthwise without removing either end to preserve the flower. Remove and discard of all seeds. Keep sliced quinces in water to prevent browning. Boil quinces in enough water such that fruit is covered. When quinces have thoroughly softened, after approximately 1 to 1.5 hrs, strain fruit through a layered cheesecloth or jelly bag with a ready bowl underneath to collect decoction (boiled water). To make syrup, boil mixture of ¾ cup port wine and 2 cups brown sugar on medium to high heat, then reduce at low heat. Stir syrup reduction into decoction over medium heat. When mixture has reduced, lower to low heat to avoid scorching. When nearly cooked, put a little on a dish using a spoon to test whether mixture holds its shape and consistency. If finished, remove mixture from heat and store in glass container.
