    In looking for recipes related to imitation emeralds and rubies in BnF Ms Fr 640, I came across a recipe for hyacinth which mentions not only rubies but also red varnish - the two recipes with which Siddhartha and I plan to engage:

    *use copper powder instead of grinding it on the surface - so we can weigh out copper powder - variable that we can play with
   </span>
   <span style="display: block; font-family: -apple-system-font; font-size: 12px;">
    *first polish off copper sheet to remove oxidation and then grind
   </span>
   <span style="display: block; font-family: -apple-system-font; font-size: 12px;">
    *can really test the variables - process has to be worked out because toxic materials

    Hyacinth
    <br/>
    It is made, like rubies, with gold; but without such intense heat.
    <strong>
     Rubies need to be heated for a whole day, and if it does not have heat for long enough, you will obtain only reddened varnish.

    Siddhartha et al. have already experimented with the imitation ruby recipe once and we plan to have a second trial on Thursday
   </span>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <span style="display: block; font-family: -apple-system-font; font-size: 12px;">
    In addition to testing variables including heat levels and amounts of salt used for the BnF imitation ruby recipe, we plan to test two recipes found in Merrifield from the Bolognese Manuscript which in one case substitutes the use of lead in BnF with wine and in the other makes a kind of moldable paste as opposed to glass as in BnF

    For the red varnish, there are many recipes for varnish, different kinds of varnish, and such varnishes as “Amber” and “Indian” which may be interesting to look at in comparison to our red varnish recipe on

    A particular point of interest for me re: varnish recipes is the application - almost all of the varnish recipes instruct the practitioner to apply the product with his/her hands - I am interested in tactility and embodied material awareness on the part of the practitioner

   <br/>
   <span style="display: block; font-family: -apple-system-font; font-size: 12px;">
    Other questions:
   </span>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <span style="display: block; font-family: -apple-system-font; font-size: 12px;">
    <br/>
    <ol>
     <li>
      Over which colors does the red varnish work best? To what effect?
     </li>
     <li>
      To what extent can general varnish recipes be adapted to the red varnish recipe in Bnf?
     </li>
     <li>
      Little indication in recipes themselves as to what purpose varnish fulfills - can we discern this be reconstructing the varnish itself?
     </li>
     <li>
      Some of the varnish recipes mention the treating of "old" paintings - how closely is a knowledge of varnish tied to what we may call conservation practices or at least a knowledge of "restoration" even in the early modern period?
     </li>
     <li>
      What can we make of "Indian" or "Chinese" varnish as distinguished from others?
     </li>
     <li>
      In the Volpato Manuscript, there is a dialogue between a master painter (it seems) and an apprentice in which varnishes are discussed - the painter explains to the apprentice that varnish can either be made or bought, depending on its intended use, but nonetheless, it is good for the painter to know how to make varnishes. What can we draw from this conversation as to the priority of knowledge within the workshop in terms of procedure but also person?
      <ol>
       <li>
        be careful that this 17th century manuscript is produced for connoisseurs - perhaps a caricature of workshop practice
       </li>
      </ol>
     </li>
     <li>
      Why are various varnish recipes seemingly unorganized within manuscripts - appear scattered slightly, not sequential
     </li>
     <li>
      Temporal aspect to making varnish - how long it takes to make and also how quickly varnish dries - temporality of process but also application
     </li>
    </ol>
    <br/>
    why long history of imitation gems - associated with elites, alchemical texts (for material reasons and representation esoteric knowledge)
