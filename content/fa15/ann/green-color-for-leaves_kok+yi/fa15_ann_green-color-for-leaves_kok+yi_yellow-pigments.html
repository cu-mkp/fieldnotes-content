   Observations
   <br/>
   <ul>
    <li>
     in both cases, very little yellow ochre pigment was needed to modify the green to a "natural" color resembling living plants
    </li>
    <li>
     both ochres were from France, but different regions, and produced completely different tones of yellow
     <ul>
      <li>
       similarly, we had two bottles of verdigris in the lab harvested at different times (and not from the same original batch) that looked like they had very different color tones--I used the more finely powdered in a small beaker, but the other had a more turquoise tone
      </li>
     </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
     The inexactness of the recipe might stem partly from the thought that there was no use in being exact. For example, if a practitioner in a slightly different area of France were to attempt this recipe, he might get very different results because of slight variations in his ingredients. The recipe provides a rough guide that gives practitioners room to experiment and adjust to their own circumstances.

   <br/>
   Jenny and I had a safety meet with Kathy Heinemann from Health and Safety (see lead and verdigris safety in procedures). We talked about safe disposal of white lead, yellow lead, and verdigris. All materials should be cleaned in linseed oil and paper towels. The paper towels can be disposed of as solid hazardous waste in a labeled container (label with full scientific or chemical name). We need to have a separate liquid waste container for the filtrate water from white lead pigment. It is OK to leave the drying substrate from the weld/white lead pigment covered in a closed fume hood. Verdigris and lead paper towels can be put in the same solid waster container.

    [Principal Recipe 2: Green]
   </h1>
   [Annotation Plans]
   <br/>
   This recipe is relevant because it pays attention to how colors (primarily green and yellow, as in the damask recipe) are mixed, albeit in a different medium (oil paint) than our principle recipe. It gives detailed instructions on how to make different hues of green, some of which are mixed with yellows which may also be used in making dyes. The recipe is specifically for painting on metal casts, to give the cast plant--for example, marigold flowers, as the author specifies--a more lifelike color.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Merrifield discusses how dyes and pigments can have the same basis or be derived from the same plant through different processing methods.
   <br/>
   Merrifield, pg. 7
   <br/>
   It is certain that these passages relate to the preparation of transparent colours for painting; but I think that they refer also to the art of dyeing, and to the decoration of wearing apparel. No. 92 is evidently a mordant, and was used both to prepare the cloth to receive the colours, and to bleach certain parts of coloured cloths, by which a regular pattern might be given to them...

   Trials

   <strong>
    Yellow Ochre
   </strong>
   <br/>
   From Cennini: Ocher color is of two sorts, light and dark. Each color calls for the same method of working up with clear water; and work it up thoroughly, for it goes on getting better...And this color is coarse by nature.
   <br/>
   <ol>
    <li>
     Mix together approx. 1 g yellow ochre and 2 ml water (vary ochre and water amounts for saturation, until it grinds smoothly) with glass muller on glass board until smooth (try both French ochre Sahara and Burgundy Yellow Ochre)
    </li>
    <li>
     paint on board (about 4 layers?--until color is opaque)
    </li>
    <li>
     grind approx 1 g yellow ochre with 2 ml linseed oil
    </li>
    <li>
     paint on board
    </li>
    <li>
     grind approx 1 g verdigris in 2 ml linseed oil
     <ol>
      <li>
       SAFETY When working with verdigris, wear nitrile gloves; clean all materials used with verdigris with linseed oil; wash brushes in linseed oil until clean, then rinse all materials with water and soap; linseed oil for cleaning should be absorbed with paper towels and put in solid hazardous waste
      </li>
     </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
     combine verdigris with yellow ochre (can vary amount of each pigment)
    </li>
    <li>
     paint verdigris and yellow ochre mixed pigment on board
    </li>
   </ol>
   <strong>
    Massicot
   </strong>
   <br/>
   From Cennini: (On a color called giallorino, noted as massicot) This color is to be ground, like the others aforesaid, with clear water. It does not want to be worked up very much, and, since it is very troublesome to reduce it to powder, you will do well to pound it in a bronze mortar, as you have to do with the hematite, before you work it up. And when you have made use of it, it is a very handsome yellow color; for with this color, with other mixtues, as I will show you, attractive foliage and grass colors are made. And as I understand it, this color is actually a mineral, originating in the neighborhood of great volcanoes; so I tell you that it is a color produced artificially, though not by alchemy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Merrifield, Paduan Manuscript: 121. Straw colour--Take lead yellow (massicot), wash it with a very strong and clean ley, then decant the ley, and distemper with the colour with parchment glue.

   133. To make giallo santo.*--Take the berries of the buckthorn towards the end of the month of August, boil them with pure water. until the water is loaded and thick with colour; add a little burnt roche alum and then strain it. You may boil the strained liquor to make the colour deeper, mixing with it some very pure gilder's gesso; then make the colour into pellets, and dry them in the shade. *In the Nuovo Plico, Giallo Santo is said to be made of the flowers of the Erba Lizza, Barbi de Becco (yellow goat's beard). We may, therefore, safely infer that it was a yellow lake made sometimes with the juice of one plant, and sometimes with that of another.

    In a note in 2015 Cennini (pg. 209): In other recipes, sources of calcium carbonate or calcium sulphate are often used as substrates in making pink sappanwood lakes, with lead white being used sometimes for bulk and colour. Alcherius, the Bolognese Manuscript and the Venetian Manuscript have recipes which omit quicklime but include variously powered eggshells, marble dust, chalk, leadwhite and gypsum (Merrifield 1849: 1: 52-4, 94, 270, 282-4, 292; 2: 438-9; Tosatti 1991: 190-1).

   Merrifield, Brussels manuscript (1635) can be adapted: 194. To make good and fine arzica Take 1 lb of weld, which the dyers use, cut it very fine, then put it into a glazed or tinned base, and add it to enough water to cover the herb. Make it boil until the water is half wasted, and if there is not enough water add a sufficient quantity and no more; then take 2 oz. travertine (q.v.) finely ground, or 2 oz. white lead, and half oz. of roche alum ground very fine, then put all these things together a little at a time to boil in the vase directly, before the water cools, and stir the water continually, removed the vessel from the fire, and when nearly dry, pour off the water. Then take a new brick hollow in the middle, layer the arzica on it, and let it settle perfectly; then put it on a small and well polished board to dry, and it is done.

   &lt;head&gt;Colors for green leafs&lt;/head&gt;
   <br/>
   <br/>
   &lt;ab&gt;One usually paints them with oil colors, because distemper colors do not stay on. For marigold flowers, lightly ground minium for some of them; for more yellowish ones, mix in a bit of massicot. For green, the vert-de-gris is dark and too somber. If it is a yellowish-green, you can mix with the vert-de-gris a bit of yellow ochre and scudegrun. If the green is dark, mix in some coals made from peach pits, which makes a greenish-black, in the same way than the bone of an ox foot bone makes a bluish-black. And in such a manner, by judgement and discretion, put the color on the natural flower or leaf to see whether it is similar to the original. But paint it on very lightly so as not to cover the features of the work.&lt;/ab&gt;

    A very good quality yellow dye is obtained from the whole plant, but especially from the flowers and young shoots[4, 9, 11, 57, 66, 141, 169, 244]. It produces a very good quality green when mixed with woad (Isatis tinctoria)[11, 238]. Alum, cream of tartar and sulphate of lime are used to fix the colour[4]. The stems can be dried and stored until the dye is required[169]. A fibre obtained from the stems is used for coarse cloth and cordage[4, 169]. Plants can be used as a ground cover when spaced about 45cm apart each way[208]. The cultivar 'Flore Pleno' is always dwarf and is more reliable than the species[208].
