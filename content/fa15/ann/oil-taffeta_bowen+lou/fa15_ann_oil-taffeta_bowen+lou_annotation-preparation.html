     Both 10v and 42v use oil painting on taffeta, so it's really important that the fabric we choose resembles that that the author practioner might have used. A lot of the taffeta for sale now is not silk (which we've determined is what traditional taffeta is) but polyester, so we have to pick 100% silk taffeta.
    </li>
    <li>
     10v uses batture (glue soaked in water with honey added) applied to the fabric, while 42v uses a mixture of alum water, essence of amidin, honey.
    </li>
    <li>
     For taffeta we need to look at Villers, C.
     <em>
      The Fabric of Images: European Paintings on Textile Supports in the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Centuries
     </em>
     . (London, 2000). 19, 90.
    </li>
    <li>
     Then we looked into alum--the manuscript just says "alum" but there are a few things it could be and we don't want to just use potash alum without knowing if it's right.
    </li>
    <li>
     We found an article: Bruckle, Irene. "The Role of Alum in Historical Papermaking"
     <em>
      Abbey Newsletter
     </em>
     17 (Sept 1993). Her article is related more specifically to papermaking, but makes reference to other historical uses of alum, and is still helpful.
     <ul>
      <li>
       "Aluminum potassiam sulfate was used throught the history of papermaking until the 19th century."
      </li>
      <li>
       "In Europe, the use of alum for hardening gelatin sizes is recorded during the 16th century"
      </li>
      <li>
       "Watercolorists brushed their gelatin-alum sized papers with an alum solution to ensure or improve their uniform moisture resistance."
      </li>
      <li>
       In Randle Cotgrave,
       <em>
        Dictionarie of the French and English Tongues
       </em>
       (London 1611):
       <ul>
        <li>
         "Colle: f. Glue; also, solder; also, the unprofitable corners of hides, and skinnes, cut off in the dressing."
        </li>
        <li>
         "Colle forte. Ordinarie white glue; as in Colle de cerf."
        </li>
        <li>
         "Colle de cerf. as Forte; White, and cleere-coloured glue; made of the skinnes of all kind of soure-footed beastes."
        </li>
       </ul>
      </li>
     </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
     42v calls for using "eau d'amydon" with alum water, and honey as a first layer on the fabric. Amidin was a bit of a "mystery ingredient" to us, but we've put together that it's a wheat paste.
     <ul>
      <li>
       The manuscript has a note on amidin which says :

          Qu'est - ce donc que l'amydon? c'est un sédiment de blé gâté, ou de griots &amp; recoupettes de bon blé, dont on fait une espece de pâte blanche &amp; friable, &amp; qu'on prépare en suivant le procédé que nous venons d'expliquer.

         We obviously need to look at the rest of this resource, but most important is that it's a spoiled wheat which is made into a paste.

       Naomi linked us to an article about wheat starch paste which discusses its uses and construction: Sanderson, Katherine. "Making it Stick: Paste on Paper"

       26 (2007) 155-159

        <li>
         "Wheat starch paste is something that most book and paper conservators use with regularity, and there seem to be almost as many recipes for making it as there are conservators who use it." 155.
        </li>
        <li>
         The procedure is listed: "Combine 50 mL wheat-starch (about 30g) with 100 mL of water. Cover and soak the starch at room temperature for the desired amount of time. Transfer the starch/water mixture to a pot and begin to cook, stirring constantly, over moderate heat. Heat 150 mL of water in another small pot over high heat. Just before the remaining heated water boils, add it slowly to the starch/water mixture, stirring the paste vigorously (adding pre-heated water hastens the cooking process). Cook for 35 minutes, stirring constantly. Remove paste from heat. Fill the syringes with the hot paste, trying to avoid the inclusion of air bubbles. Rinse the tip and cap of the syringe with reagent alcohol before and after each syringe is filled. Cap each syringe immediately after filling." 157.

         She notes 1 hour as the preferred soaking time. (p.157.)

    Subject: Preparing the Safety Protocol
   </strong>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   We were working on preparing our safety protocol, which made us look back at our recipes to determine exactly which steps we would follow. In doing so, we noticed an interesting omission in the procedure: there is no indication of where the taffeta is used.
   <br/>
   10v and 42v don't specify at which point the taffeta enters into the procedure. It is rather unclear if the taffeta should be soaked with the glue, or if the layer of batture should be applied to the taffeta afterward.
   <br/>
   32r mentions a layer of batture, just like 10v. and says:
   <br/>
   <span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Arial; font-size: 14.66px;">
    "Scribes&lt;/pro&gt; and mediocre &lt;pro&gt;painters&lt;/pro&gt; make &lt;m&gt;“batture”&lt;/m&gt;, which is &lt;m&gt;joiner’s glue&lt;/m&gt; tempered in &lt;m&gt;water&lt;/m&gt; over the fire, somewhat clear, mixed with very little &lt;m&gt;honey&lt;/m&gt;, that is a few drops to make it thicken, and then they use it to draw letters or whatever they want to &lt;m&gt;gild&lt;/m&gt; with a brush, and immediately after lay down the &lt;m&gt;gold&lt;/m&gt;, but the work they do is never quite neat, and if there is a lot of &lt;m&gt;honey&lt;/m&gt; it dries only with great difficulty. This layer will be damaged in the rain. &lt;/ab&gt;"
   </span>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This passage mirrors the description of batture in 10v, and seems to answer our question: batture is a glue that's soaked in water (which tell us it's not our taffeta which is soaked in water) until it's someone clear (which tells us that this is to dilute the glue) and mixed with honey to thicken (this will help us when determining how much honey to add to our own mixture.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   So our plan now is to make the batture by soaking the glue with water, boiling it, adding some honey, and then adding this layer (probably by painting) onto the taffeta.

    Subject: Making Alum Water
   </strong>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   We began by measuring 100 mL of tap water (the recipe on 73r, from which we were working, says alum and river water, but we made the decision to use tap water). We came up with this ratio by searching the solubility of potash alum, where we discovered that 36.8g to 100mL of water at 50deg.C is the appropriate ratio.
   <br/>
   Then we measured 36.8g of potash alum.
   <br/>
   We turned the hotplate on to low heat (1), placed the beaker with water on, and added the potash.

   You need to prepare the cloth with fish or leather scrap glue, mixed with a bit of starch forstrengthening. Heat it with a little honey and apply this mixture to your fabric. Let it dry and then coat it with oil with lead monoxide. […] When I wondered whether the honey would dry, he answered yes, because painters who make flags and emblems for the purposes of war use it as well out of fear that the taffeta, coated with glue to avoid the pulling of the colors applied with oil paint, will become brittle and show cracks and creases.

   We moved the wheat starch soaked in water to a hot plate on low heat. The mixture had separated, with a thick white mixture settled on the bottom and the water resting on top. As we began to stir, the substance at the bottome was very thick, but after using a bit of force in mixing, the substance combined with the water and became easier to stir. The mixture is opaque, and looks like milk

   THe alum water has dissolved and we have labelled 4 squares of taffeta.
   <br/>
   1: 25 ml of alum water, 25 ml of wheat starch paste, 1ml honey
   <br/>
   2. 25ml of wheat starch paste, 40 ml of alum water, 1ml honey
   <br/>
   3: 25ml of wheat starch paste, 10ml of alum water, 1ml honey
   <br/>
   4: 25 ml of wheat starch paste, 0 ml of alum water, 1ml honey
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The recipe specified a few drops of honey, so we went with 1ml.
   <br/>
   The manuscript did not specify how to apply the layer, so we chose pallette knives.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   1:More like water, the amidin did not saturate the alum water, there are some slight chunks. Kind of looks like the gesso, but a bit thinner.The color of the mixture is an off-white, rather opaque mixture, with small white chunks (likely from the amidin). The taffeta soaks up the mixture fairly well, but it doesn't leak through (the reverse side has a few dark spots, but is otherwise dry)
   <br/>
   2: Slightly more liquid-y than 1, still with chunks of amidin, but looks very similar in color to 1. The mixture goes on easily, spreads well and only leaks through in spots.
   <br/>
   3: Much thicker than 1 or 2. The pallette knife kind of sticks to the fabric when applying. The mixture has no chunks, it is smooth to apply. Can be applied much more evenly.
   <br/>
   4: Extremely viscous. No liquid quality at all. Spreads very evenly but VERY sticky. The pallette knife comes up with the fabric regularly. Though it spreads very evenly it doesn't smooth out--there is evidence of the different brush strokes.

   The taffeta squares dried overnight.
   <br/>
   1: The surface has white streaks, with powdery, crystalline specks in the creases (they do not come off the fabric if you brush it). The edges of the sheet have come up a bit (if they weren't accidentally glued down) The crystals look like the potash alum.
   <br/>
   2: SImilar to 1 there is a residue in the creases, although unlike 1 there are no streaks.The crystals look like the potash alum. The edges have curled up significantly more.
   <br/>
   3: There is no residue and no streaks. 1 corner has curled up completely. Stayed fairly flat otherwise.
   <br/>
   4. Curled over the most. No residue. The surface is much more bumpy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <strong>
    10:24
   </strong>
   We take our mixture of rabbit skin glue ground and water (which has been soaking since yesterday) and place it over a low heat in order to fully dissolve the crystals.
   <br/>
   <strong>
    10:52
   </strong>
   We removed it from the heat, all particles dissolved. The mixture is a light yellow.
   <br/>
   We also cut parchment into strips to make parchment (or mouth) glue
   <br/>
   <strong>
    10:55
   </strong>
   We decide to test the rabbit skin glue by separating in into 2: one will be diluted with water (as per the manuscript's instructions) and one will be left as it is.
   <br/>
   For the diluted batch, we separate 100mL of glue, to be placed with 500mL of water. We arrived at this ratio by looking at Marjolijn Bol's recipe, where she uses a ratio of 1:10 rsg to water. Our initial ratio for making the glue was more water-y than hers, so we shifted our ratio accordingly.
   <br/>
   After adding the glue to the water, the water is very lightly colored.
   <br/>
   <strong>
    11:00
   </strong>
   We added honey to our blue mixture to make the batture
   <br/>
   1: 25mL rsg to 1mL honey
   <br/>
   2:25mL rsg to 2mL honey
   <br/>
   <br/>
   We put them on a low heat to boil.
   <br/>
   <strong>
    11:15
   </strong>
   For the parchment glue, the recipe calls for the scraps to be "whipped" or batu, so we put the scraps in a mortar and pounded it with the pestle for a few minutes.
   <br/>
   We measured the scraps, and we have 6.28g of parchment.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <strong>
    11:27
   </strong>
   We removed the glue/honey from the heat
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <strong>
    11:30
   </strong>
   We put the batture on taffeta
   <br/>
   1: More even to apply than the amidin alum water mix (no particles!) Smooth. The thickness is like very thin honey--
   <br/>
   2:Fairly liquid-y, but easy to apply. It spreads easiley though it is slightly stickey (the pallete knife brings the taffeta up with it if lifted). Soaks through the taffeta.
   <br/>
   <strong>
    11:40
   </strong>
   We put the parchment scraps in a small dish and covered them with enough grain alcohol to cover them (about 45mL)
   <br/>
   <strong>
    11:50
   </strong>
   1 (1mL of honey) is still wet, while 2 (2mL of honey) is mainly dry
   <br/>
   A particular recipe said that the honey slowed down the drying process, but the one with more honey has dried faster.
   <br/>
   <strong>
    12:00pm
   </strong>
   We made apigment using cold pressed linseed oil and madder lake (made in the lab, Fall 2015 Sample D)
   <br/>
   We pained a line vertically and diagonally on each square. We didn't have a lot of oil paint, so we were not encouraged by the prospect (it didn't seem like there would be enough to drip)
   <br/>
   As we drew the lines, we on noticed 1.2 and 2.2 the colors were darker. Then we noticed around the edges of the lines, the oil spread further, leaving a dark shadow around the line, while these did not appear on 3.2 and 4.2. After a moment shadows appeared around 3.2, but not as noticeably as 1.2 and 2.2. The control had large shadows.
   <br/>
   1.1 and 2.1 had no oil marks.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The alum water seems to make the color darker, but it also tends to make the oil separate more severely. However, the control square (with nothing on it at all) also had large oil marks, so something is needed on the taffeta.

   Our parchment scraps, which have been soaking oversnight, are placed ona hotplate over a low heat. Since we used alcohol with such a high percentage of alcohol per volume (~95%) when the manuscript likely used something less strong (like a brandy, ~40%) we added 10 ml of water, to dilute the alcohol a bit and this also then covered the scraps completely. The liquid then got a little murky.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   OUr rsg which had been soaking in water overnight is now a light, off-white, slightly murky color. The consistency is also a bit more viscous--now where near as thick as our amidin paste, but still more glue-like than water.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <strong>
    11:25:
   </strong>
   We measured out two more glue honey batture mixtures
   <br/>
   3.1: 25 ml of rsg in water, 1 ml honey
   <br/>
   4.1: 25ml of rsg in water, 2ml honey
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Our parchment scraps, which are being gently boiled, have gotten thicker and softer, though the recipe calls for them to be melted.
   <br/>
   We painted the batture on the taffeta squares:
   <br/>
   <br/>
   3.1: It feels like liquid. I put fingers on the taffeta after applying and it is not sticky at all. It is very wet. To make a comparison experiment, I apply batture on the other side of taffeta for the middle stripe to see if we will have different effects for preventing oil running.

    For our parchment glue, we decide to split what we have in 2. (What we have is a milky looking liquid and thick parchment scraps that look very much like the animal skin they are. The consistency of the liquid is very much just water.) We leave the parchment scraps in because we're not sure if they're still necessary (the recipe said to melt them but they just got thicker and more rubbery)

   We took our parchment glue (one of which was 30ml of glue in 150 ml of water [hereafter referred to as colle forte] the other was 30ml of glue) and put them on a low heat. It has been 12 days since we made the glue and the colle forte glue (the glue soaked in water) gave off a strong odor, so we heated it on a hot plate in a fume hood. We heated it until it was gently boiled.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The glue that had not been soaked in water had congealed a bit during the waiting period, and the parchment scraps (which we left in) were very thick. The glue which had been soaked in water was pretty much just a water-y mixture, though the color was a little murky and there were slightly gritty particles in the liquid.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <strong>
    10:25:
   </strong>
   The glue (which had been congealed) liquified and boiled fairly quickly, leaving us with again a very water mixture with no evident viscosity. The parchment scraps stayed thick and rubbery.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The colle forte is still on the heat, not yet boiling, but it too shows no signs of viscosity.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <strong>
    10:35:
   </strong>
   We cut 3 new taffeta squares. We
   <br/>
   <br/>
   5.1: 25 ml of colle forte (30ml parchment glue soaked in 150 ml of water), 1ml of honey
   <br/>
   6.1 25 ml of colle forte (30ml parchment glue soaked in 150ml of water), 5ml of honey
   <br/>
   7.1 20ml of parchment glue, 1 ml of honey
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For 6.1, we decided to use much more honey than we have previously to see if it actually makes a difference in softening the fabric.
   <br/>
   <strong>
    Note on softening: in the manuscript it mentions honey to "soften" the tafetta, which didn't make a lot of sense to us at first, but we found on painting the layer on the taffeta, that the fabric gets rather stiff and crinkled, so this might be what the author-practioner is seeking to remedy
   </strong>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <strong>
    10:45
   </strong>
   We separated the parchment glue from the scraps and ended up with just 20 ml of glue, while we had put 30 ml in the beaker. So the other 10ml may have evaporated when we boiled it, or been soaked up by the scraps
   <br/>
   5.1 and 6.1 had little white particles in them.
   <br/>
   We added the honey to our glues and boiled them again.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <strong>
    11:05
   </strong>
   We painted the layers on the squares
   <br/>
   5.1 Very liquidy. Not sticky at all. Soaked through the taffeta and did not spread easily
   <br/>
   6.1 Much thicker than 5.1, spread much more easily. Soaked through quite a bit.
   <br/>
   7.1 Had a slight bit of viscosity when the palette knife went in, but after a bit of mixing that went away and it was very difficult to spread. The surface was slightly sticky, and the layer went through the taffeta in a couple sticky spots.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <strong>
    12:30
   </strong>
   We painted a stripe vertically and diagonally on 3.1, 4.1, 5.1, 6.1, 7.1
   <br/>
   We used madder lake pigment (From Sample D, made in Fall 2015 in the lab) mixed with Cold Pressed Linseed oil.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   We then decided to paint a stripe in Linseed stand oil (which is thicker) to see if that made a difference with the paint. We decided to pick only a few of our previous samples to try this on. In looking at our previous samples we noticed that the oil had spread on most of them, but that it took a few weeks for it to visible. This suggests that there is a long term effect to the efficacy, but that maybe that wasn't important. This may support the idea of this as an ephemeral product--if you only need the oil not to run for a short amount of time it doesn't matter if the final product doesn't look as good weeks later.
