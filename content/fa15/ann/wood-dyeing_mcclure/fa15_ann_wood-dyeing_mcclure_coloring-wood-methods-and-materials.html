    <li>
     Put on eye protection, mask, lab coat, and gloves.
    </li>
    <li>
     Combine white vinegar, verdigris, and rock alum in stainless steel pot; carefully mix contents.
    </li>
    <li>
     Place pot on hot plate in fume hood until very hot, but do not boil.
    </li>
    <li>
     Warm empty jars in hot water to avoid temperature shock and shattering. Place the three sheets of dry wood in one jar and the soaked sheets of wood in another; pour hot dye from pot into each jar until it covers the wood but you can still close lid without contents overflowing. If needed put a small block of scrap wood just beneath the lid to ensure veneers remain completely covered by dye.
    </li>
    <li>
     Label lid of jar with wood type, dye type, and date.
    </li>
    <li>
     Drain any remaining dye into a separate glass jar and label with date. Reserve for later use.
    </li>
    <li>
     Place jar in crock pot filled with 12 cups water set to warm. Let rest covered for 15 days.
    </li>
    <li>
     After 15 days pour contents of one jar plus half of the reserved excess dye from before into a beaker; place pot on on hot plate in fume hood heat until boiling for three hours. Periodically check for change of color, if any.
    </li>
    <li>
     After three hours remove from heat. Take out veneers and let them rest of a paper towel until dry; record and photograph findings. Cut small strip from side of veneer with the jewler's saw to check penetration of the dye.

    <li>
     Repeat steps 8 and 9 with second jar of wood and dye. Can be done simultaneously.

   <br/>
   <br/>
   Using Safety Data Sheet for copper acetate:
   <br/>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Chemwatch hazard rating shows verdigris is moderately toxic, but acutely toxic if ingested or inhaled. Also a moderate eye and skin irritant. It is especially dangerous to aquatic life; leftover dye
     <strong>
      and the wastewater from cleaning/rinsing
     </strong>
     cannot be drained in the sink

    <li>
     When heating verdigris dye do so in the fume hood.

    Wood veneers
   </strong>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   According to Pierre Ramond wood veneers were exclusively produced by skilled workers using large frame saws to cut sheets as thin as 1-2 mm until the nineteenth century, but with the advent of industrialization new methods such as slicing or rotary cutting came into wide use. Even though these new manufacturing methods allowed for quicker sheet production they also required extensive pre- and post- treatments including steaming or boiling logs for varying lengths of time according to the hardness of the wood and open air of kiln drying after cutting; sawed veneers required no such treatments and are thus considered superior in quality as the natural color and fiber of the wood is not changed. Due to lower manufacturing costs and faster production times the majority of veneers produced today are sliced or rotary cut, with sawn veneers, if available, costing much more [

   ]. Beyond the issue of historical authenticity, modern treatment methods (steaming, drying, ageing, etc.) cause changes in the levels of tannic acids in the wood that may very well affect the efficacy of the dyeing process. Due to constraints in both cost and availability for the purpose of these reconstructions I elected to use three different hardwoods commonly used in marquetry and furniture making, all varying in hardness and natural lightness of color: lindenwood (also called basswood, the softest and lightest in color), mahogany, and cherry (darkest and hardest). I sourced all of these veneers from a local art supply store and all sheets were cut to a thickness of 1/16”, roughly 1.6 mm (although actual thicknesses varied slightly from sheet to sheet). While the method of production used for these sheets is not indicated on the product the low cost and availability is likely an indication they were made using modern mechanized techniques.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After lightly sanding each larger sheet of veneer with 1000 grit sandpaper I cut each panel down into 2”x3” pieces. To easily distinguish one wood type from another I removed two corners from the lindenwood pieces, one corner from the mahogany, and kept the cherry wood intact. While our author-practitioner gives no direction on how the wood you intend to dye should be prepared before soaking in the bath, based on directions found in other dye recipes from the seventeenth and eighteenth century and suggestions in conservation literature I chose to soak one set of veneers in water for a period of 48 hours before dyeing while the other set was added dry. In Chapter XXV of his 1675 publication Polygraphice, William Salmon instructs that all materials intended to be dyed must first be boiled in alum water, and over a century later in the manual The laboratory, or, School of arts, Godfrey Smith likewise directs that “the wood is first to be thoroughly soaked in alum water.” Similarly noting that the acidity and porosity of wood will affect the final dye result, in their attempts to recreate early synthetic dyes from the 19th century van Bommel and Fantini soaked their woods in either plain water or a solution of 5% ammonia or salt water. In order to purge some of the water from the pre-soaked wood the pieces were briefly wiped down and set to rest on a paper towel about 30 minutes before adding dye.

    Incubating dyes/ finding a replacement for composting manure
   </strong>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In addition to the issue of sourcing woods, the method laid out for all the dyeing recipes in fol. 76r specifies resting the pot containing your dye bath and wood in manure for a period of 15 days. As thermophilic bacteria are the primary agents of composting, burying in manure was a common method for keeping an item at a relatively warm, stable temperature for a long period of time. Unfortunately, procuring a sufficiently large pile of composting manure in New York during the winter proved impractical, so I needed to devise an alternative means of incubating the soaking wood and dye. The first difficulty in overcoming this particular methodological obstacle was determining the temperature of the incubator. As the bacteria break down compost over time the temperature of the pile may fluctuate between 32 degrees to over 70 degrees celsius. While these temperatures may vary depending on the size of the pile, available nutrients for bacteria, and ambient temperature, it’s clear that manure can sustain relatively warm environments for extended periods of time. I ultimately decided to let the soaking samples rest at a comparatively high temperature within the range of possibilities given above as another wood dyeing recipe on fol. 78r specifies laying your vessel containing the dye in “very warm horse dung” for a period of eight or nine days. After extensive consideration and testing I found that with the lid on my generic brand Crock-pot keeps water at a temperature of roughly 66 degrees celsius when set to “warm,” which is within the upper bounds of temperatures expected in composting manure.

   &lt;ab&gt;Some take Lapathium acutum maius, which seems to be rhapontic rhubarb or “vinette”, and using the root, which is yellow in summer, they dye threads and similar things.&lt;/ab&gt; [This isn’t actually giving a recipe for dye, but for a source of pigment]

   &lt;ab&gt;One must not grind it only with &lt;m&gt;water&lt;/m&gt;, because this makes it fade. To obtain a beautiful distemper, some people crush it with &lt;m&gt;vinegar&lt;/m&gt;. But this makes it turn pale and become whitish. To make it beautiful, crush it with &lt;m&gt;urine&lt;/m&gt; and leave it to dry. Then, when you will want, crush it with &lt;m&gt;oil&lt;/m&gt;. And after you have collected it with the palette, instead of finishing cleaning the &lt;m&gt;marble&lt;/m&gt;, crush it there with &lt;m&gt;scudegrun&lt;/m&gt; and you will have a very beautiful green.&lt;/ab&gt;

      NOTE
     </strong>
     : Alum-water seems to be important for the dyeing process both in terms of fixing/mordant properties BUT ALSO in changing the color of the dye itself.

       [42] “take a very strong lye, and soak in it shavings of brazillium, and ground a lumen glaciae; and let it stand for five days or more, and it will be of a blood colour. Whatever you mean to dye, you nut soak in it for three days, and then boil it until what you have put in it is properly dyed.”

     The author of the

     claims pear wood is the “proper” wood for dyeing black and red, “because it is naturally much inclined to redden.” (818)
     <ul>
      <li>
       “”To make wood the color of Brazil wood, rub it with distempered quicklime. The lime penetrates and thus makes it of a red color. If the wood be afterwards rubbed with oil it will be more beautiful. Remember that pear-tree wood is more proper for this than any other wood, because it is naturally much inclined to redden.”
