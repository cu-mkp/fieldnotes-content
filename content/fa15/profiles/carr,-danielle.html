I'm a doctoral student in anthropology, interested in the notion of the volitional will as it operates in juridical and psychiatric praxis in the US. I mainly study brain implants and addiction, but I'm also interested in the liberal political stakes of the emergence of neurology in Britain during the late 17th century.
