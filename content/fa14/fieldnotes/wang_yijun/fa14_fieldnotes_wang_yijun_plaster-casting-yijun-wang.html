<ul><li>After Tonny’s talk on sand casting, we continue to make our wax model.</li><li>I gave up my previous wax and chose an easier model: a Banliang (<span class="s2">半两</span>) style bronze coin in the Qing Dynasty.</li><li>I made the wax thinner and carved a square whole in the center. Then I carved seal inscriptions of Chinese characters “Banliang” (literary means half taels of bronze) at the surface.</li><li>Just as last time, the wax started to melt in my hand. So the bottom was not flat enough.</li><li>The wax was too sticky that I couldn’t create clean lines in my inscription.</li></ul><br />

<ul><li>The plaster model was dried and hardened. I pulled it out easily from the clay.</li><li>Tonny pointed out that I should make the surface flat and clean so that I can make a good sand cast. The wall of the inscription should be in a gradual slope for sand cast. Also the rim of the coin should be smooth and with hard edges to make it more touch friendly. Furthermore, the thickness of my plaster model was not even. So I had to make it even.</li><li>Using sand paper, I polished the upper surface and bottom to get rid of the unevenness. I used the file to polish the rim of my plaster model to remove sharp angles.</li><li><img src="files/2014_001Fall_labsem_plaster%20casting_polishing%20plaster_10.10.2014.jpg" alt="2014_001Fall_labsem_plaster casting_polishing plaster_10.10.2014.jpg" title="2014_001Fall_labsem_plaster casting_polishing plaster_10.10.2014.jpg" style="height: 512px; width: 388px;" /></li><li>Using was carving tools, I “remade” the inscription by scratching the plaster, making the inscriptions deeper and clearer.</li><li>The heavily worked plaster looked much better than my wax model!</li><li><img src="files/2014_001Fall_labsem_plaster%20casting_polished%20plaster%20model_10.10.2014.jpg" alt="2014_001Fall_labsem_plaster casting_polished plaster model_10.10.2014.jpg" title="2014_001Fall_labsem_plaster casting_polished plaster model_10.10.2014.jpg" style="height: 499px; width: 377px;" /></li><li>Tonny pointed out that we should add some hardener to our wax instead of using 100% beeswax. The hardener would prevent the wax from being sticky so that we can work with wax the way we worked with plaster.</li></ul>
