   Location: Chandler Lab 260

    Beeswax pouring with self-made bread molds
   </strong>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For materials and equipments see video/photograph documentation (reference signature for photo/videomaterial needs still to be filled in here. Following up the thoughtful recommendations made by our guest lecturer, Jeffrey Lancaster, on Lab notes during our last session, we had an animated disucssion about a proper reference system that ties photographs, texts and objects together... to be continued)
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The beeswax was heated until fluid on single burner, using variable medium temperature.
   <br/>
   We made small lips into paper coffee cups
   <br/>
   We first poured the beeswax into paper coffee cups;
   <br/>
   then we carefully filled the bread molds with beeswax using the paper coffee cups.
   <br/>
   We poured the beeswax gently and slowly.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Some samples did not fill up very well, because they had cracks or open spaces through which the wax leaked out.
   <br/>
   In some cases we tried to fill up the cracks with wax and poured more wax into the mold, and that seemed to work fine for some molds.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   We had some good examples where the wax casts came out very well and quite easily from the bread molds, but in all cases the pith stuck to the wax and had to be peeled off carefully.There were some good results with detailed surface impressions (see photographic documentation).
   <br/>
   We did not have access yet to warm water in the lab, so we took our casts home to further clean them up there.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Note: Our molds had been already made a week or longer ago. The molds therefore had been probably shrinking and curling on the edges.

   <em>
    PERHAPS JOEL CAN FILL IN ON THESE NOTES FROM HIS EXPERIENCE IN MAKING THE MIXES? AND OTHERS ON THEIR EXPERIENCES OF HOW THEIR CASTS CAME OUT, LOOKED AND FELT AND WHETHER THEY NOTICED DIFFERENCES WHEN USING DIFFERENT BREAD MOLDS?
   </em>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   We experimented with 3 fillings
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <strong>
    Pure bees wax
   </strong>
   <br/>
   because of the colour of the wax you could not see the details very well, but it when cleaining under water one could see very detailed impressions on the little pill bottle
   <br/>
   bees wax slightly more transparant, diffuses the light
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <strong>
    Mixtures of wax and tallow 50/50
   </strong>
   <br/>
   tallow and wax, objects burst and cracked, MS says to add tallow to make it softer, we probably added too much wax
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Dinosaur cast (add pictures and/or references to pictures)
   <br/>
   The wax/tallow mixture popped out beautifully, without sticking to the breadmold at all. It has a detailed impression and feels quite soft and fatty. The breadmold could even be reused for sulfur cast (see below)
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <strong>
    Pure sulfur
   </strong>
   <br/>
   much easier to get out of mold, had the most detailed impressions
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Dinosaur cast (add pictures/reference sign)
   <br/>
   The sulfur cast broke when I tried to get it out of the breadmold, its is much harder and more brittle than the wax/tallow. The impressions seem even more detailed and pronounced than the wax/tallow, but that could also be due to the different colours, the soft white yellow one showing looking less pronounced than the greenish yellow of the sulfur.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <strong>
    On sulfur and wax
   </strong>
   <br/>
   It is still a mystery how the bees wax works with sulfur, sulfur melts at much higher temperature than sulfur at 240 degrees fahrenheit and it did not mix in our experiment with wax;
   <br/>
   In the MS it says you pass sulfur "through" wax p139v , in our experiment we kept two seperate liquids they did not mix, we tried to cast it, but also in the mold they separated.
   <br/>

    Make the first casting twice as large as other molds. And if, in the first casting, your work fills with bubbles and in so doing does not come out neatly, it’s all the same, because you have to face the fact that the three or four first do not readily come out well. Firstly, you will know whether there are a few barbs that keep it from stripping well. And you will remove them if, on their own, they do not remove themselves in the two or three first castings. And the more that you cast, the more you will do it neatly. And your mold will serve you more than one hundred times if it Is well governed. But it is good to soak it one night or one day before casting so that it be well soaked. The same must be done for fruits made from sugar. This wax is very soft &amp; friendly &amp; pliant, like copper. And if it is hard [this is] because of sulfur, which makes it melt more easily than than other [wax], so much that you can see evidence on a hot slate. And the sulfur that you put inside will be found the second time that you melt it, [as] cracks on the bottom. Having in this way passed through wax, it will not catch fire at all when put to a candle. And in this case, I believe that it will cast quite the medal [illegible]. One uses the same wax in place of varnish to [illegible].&lt;/ab&gt;

    &lt;ab id=“p139v_b1a”&gt;Take some white wax which is much more appropriate for this kind of work than anything else, because it is much firmer and does not leave as much filth, as much as you need to cast the animal that you propose, and no more. And [take] a half quantity of ground coal and neatly sieved through a cloth or coal sleeve, using it to give some color to your wax, that would otherwise be transparent and you will not be able to see your lines as clearly. Put your wax on the coal fire to melt. And when it is well-melted and well-liquified, take a full eared-porringer of melted wax, [and] as much sulphur as the amount of a large pulverized walnut. Melt all of over a slow fire and when it is melted, do not leave it on the fire because it will become too hot. But take it off and keep stirring it with a little stick and when it has finished bubbling and is as liquified as water, cast it into the wax that you will have previously removed from the fire. And mix and stir both of the them so that they join together. After stir in little by little while continuously mixing, the charcoal that has been repeatedly ground, and in this way it will be very well incorporated. This is how you will know that your wax has gone beyond its ideal heating point, it will release no more smoke, it will start to have lines appearing on the side and not in the middle, and those lines will be close to each other. If you cast too hot, you will not be able to separate your wax from your mold and it would stick to the cast. When it is at the right state, stir it with a little stick so that the pulverized charcoal is well mixed in and has not fallen to the bottom of the mixture. And in this way, throw it in your mold bit by bit and not in one go, because wax is not runny.&lt;/ab&gt;

    &lt;note id=“p139v_c1a”&gt;This black sulphured wax is for fashioning round figures that do not come out of the mold. And they need to be burned in the moule au noyau rather than be opened like the ones that have something jutting out or an intertwining of legs and arms. And this wax, thanks to the sulphur, will melt with little heat and leave without leaving any filth. If by some misfortune the crushed charcoal remains in ashes, when you open the mold and blow on it, it will come clean.&lt;/note&gt;

   <br/>
   Discussion on workweek with Tonny on sand mold making and of silver and tin casts made at Ubaldo’s Forge on 16 October
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On the quality of impressions in sand molds
   <br/>
   <br/>
   - two problems due to our use of pure bees wax and the quality of our sand
   <br/>
   <br/>
   harder sharper patterns would work better for detailed impressions in the sand, e.g. the coin we pressed in from Jonah.
   <br/>
   Our control cast from commercial delft sand
   <br/>
   We can observe
   <strong>
    flashing
   </strong>
   <br/>
   <strong>
    Other method to struck coins
   </strong>
   <br/>
   Ancient method
   <br/>
   Metal is made soft by annealing: heating up to a temperature that the microstructures of the crystals are in their most relaxed state.
   <br/>
   A temperature almost getting to red glow in which the metal structure is relaxing again. When you hammer or work on a metal it will get stressed, e.g. silver it is getting harder and harder, eventually cracking (point of no return). annealing is softening up and relaxing the metal again.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <strong>
    Pickle:
   </strong>
   an acid to clean of the surface oxide layers, it has no protective function for the future, you use it on silver, but not on tin
   <br/>
   <br/>
   10% Sulfuric acid in water
   <br/>
   silver comes out wonderful white like satin
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <strong>
    Flux:
   </strong>
   the flux binds with the oxide layer (the scum on the surface) and cleans it. And at the same time it is providing a protective layer for future oxidation, if you would not use it the metal will get much oxidation, it is also a preparatory agent for soldering, because the metals would not anneal if they is any oxide on their surface.
   <br/>
   You use it when we melting metal and you also use at when you are soldering to keep it clean while you work with the flame.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   we added rosin, you could also use borax as a flux
   <br/>
   Earliest fluxes, you could also use table salt in paste form
   <br/>
   Borax is the most common one
   <br/>
   More resin type fluxes, more greasy type of fluxes
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <strong>
    Sal ammoniac
   </strong>
   <br/>
   We used it in our sand, we do not why it is aided. We assume that it might also have a cleaning agent function. You want to get a very clean cast.
   <br/>
   It will react with the sand, it will solidify and prevent oxidation (?).

    &lt;ab id=”p118v_b1b”&gt;For the best [result], it is necessary to take sand already used in the core before using it in the box mold, until it can no longer be taken out.&lt;/ab&gt;

     &lt;title id=”p118v_b2”&gt;Casting in a box mold&lt;/title&gt;
    </strong>
   </span>
   <br/>
   <span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">
    &lt;ab id=”p118v_b2a”&gt;The same sand which has been used in composed heated cores, i.e. of plaster, brick and feather alum, is excellent for casting in box molds, and I have tried it as follows. I crushed the pieces which had come out of core molds in a mortar, pestling slowly, because this sand is very soft. I did not pass it through a sieve, because the feather alum mixed in, which makes it bind together, would not pass through. But I did refine upon marble what seemed to me too coarse, and having thus prepared it, I moistened it with the
    <strong>
     sal ammoniac water
    </strong>
    made of sal ammoniac the size of two walnuts, in a bottle of common water the size of a bottle in which one boils ground barley, or in a good pot of water. You should find the water fairly salty. I mixed in half a glass of sal ammoniac two silver spoonfuls of spirits. Having thus moistened the sand in order to give it a nice hold, though it still came apart easily, I sprinkled my medal with charcoal pulverized with a file to remove the oil fat, and all other fat. One must avoid these, since they hinder good stripping. I blew on the medal and molded it, and with the female part of the box mold full, I marked and made a line on the back and side of the medal, and on the nearby sand as well. In order that the second box mold take the imprint thereupon to indicate the place for making the cast, I uncovered the contour of the medal and pounced the whole side with pulverized carbon, and then I filled the male part with sand. I separated the box mold and did not strike the corners of the medal to make it strip, since that cracks the sand and makes it come apart. But I did strike the back of the box mold, holding the place of the medal on the bottom, and it molded very cleanly. If it hadn’t stripped thus, I would have waited to remove it until the box molds had been dried out over heat. I lit a row of charcoal between two little trivets of iron in the form that you see [viz. image id=”p118_d2” in the left margin], and put the back of the box molds thereupon, and the imprint on top, since in this way, they dry out slowly. And if, by chance, they should crack from being too moistened, it’s on the back that they take the harshest heat, and the imprint remains safe and whole.
   </span>
   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">
    &lt;ab id=”p118v_b2b”&gt; When I saw that they did not smoke anymore, &amp; scratching the back &amp; the front of the casting &amp; having found that they are rough &amp; firm &amp; hard on both sides, which is a good sign of their being quite dry, I leave them to cool down. I took some fine
    <strong>
     tin
    </strong>
    , one lb., &amp; one ounce of fine &amp; new
    <strong>
     lead
    </strong>
    . I melted it in a crucible just until it was a bit red. Being in this way quite hot &amp; ready to cast &amp; no sooner, I smoked every side of my box frame with the smoke of a
    <strong>
     tallow candle
    </strong>
    &amp; pressed &amp; cast &amp; everything. I set my box frame, well joined, in the press. I drew my crucible from the fire. I let it sit a bit to quench the redness of the crucible’s bottom. And wanting to cast, I threw in around two or three grains of rosin, and about the measure of a bean of
    <strong>
     looking-glass tin
    </strong>
    &amp; blended it &amp; stirred the crucible a little and cast. And the medal came out as neat as the original. I smoked it with the candle &amp; cleaned it with my

    <strong>
     bow wood
    </strong>
    . Turn it in order to make it homogeneous, as that is important for the casting. Cover the mouth of the frame with
    <strong>

    of the frame, because it would turn it sour, and make it filled with bubbles. Always cast higher than the mold. Pay attention that the cast is not too wide or too deep because the narrowest is the best one. Because when it is large, the weight of the matter which runs breaks and spreads the mold and fills the matter with bubbles. When you have casted, gently hit your frame, so that the matter spreads better.

   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">
    &lt;ab id=”p085v_b4d”&gt;[or metal] fills with bubbles. Most of all, make sure that the cast is always higher than the molded thing, since the sand swells very often when reheating, even in the middle, and therefore with the molded thing remaining higher than the cast, the metal cannot run easily or at all nor enter at all. Also make sure that the mold &amp; the cast are indeed reheated. Also cast in one go &amp; outside of the wind. And if your medal is really thin, when you want to mold it, put a card, or two or three thicknesses of paper, so that the mold will be lower than the cast. Also cast in the place where your medal is least thick &amp; where the relief is lowest.&lt;/ab&gt;
   </span>
   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">
    &lt;ab id=”p086v_b1h”&gt;When you mold, do not excessively pound on the medal that is in sand, because that prevents it from being cleanly stripped, and cracks the mold.&lt;/ab&gt;
   </span>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">
    &lt;ab id=”p086v_b1i”&gt;See to it that sand does not go over the edges of the box mold, because if the molded medal is higher than the cast, metal will not easily enter the form. Therefore, always take care that the surface of your cast surpasses the mold in a straight line. To accomplish this, if you wish, put a piece of cardboard of whatever thickness you please on top of the mold.&lt;/ab&gt;

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">
    &lt;ab id=”p086v_b1j”&gt;To prevent their large casting works from becoming too porous, founders are careful to heat their molds very well. And to know if the molds are heated enough, they tap them with their finger, and if they start ringing like a pot, they are heated enough.&lt;/ab&gt;

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">
    &lt;ab id=”p086v_b1k”&gt;In order to cast their canons cleanly, they mix with their founder’s earth some fine casting sand, if they can get any.&lt;/ab&gt;

     comments on some parts of the recipe
    </strong>
   </h2>
   "I blew on the medal and molded it, and with the female part of the box mold full, I marked and made a line on the back and side of the medal, and on the nearby sand as well"
   <br/>
   <em>
    This probably means that he draw a light line with a pencil or other device across the medal and sand
   </em>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I uncovered the contour of the medal and pounced the whole side with pulverized carbon"
   <br/>
   <em>
    <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">
     This refers to ‘dusting’ the outer line of the medal, e.g. to clear its contours of any sand.
    </span>
   </em>
   <br/>
   <em>
    <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">
     Pouncing probably means to have charcoal in a small sack of cotton on a stick and then pouncing the powder on to it, which would result in a very fine layer of charcoal dust (we used brushes to brush on the charcoal powder)

    <strong>
     DISCUSSION Questions
    </strong>
   </h2>
   <br/>
   1) First issue:
   <br/>
   We did not use
   <strong>
    feather alum
   </strong>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Go through MS and look where is he using feather alum.
   <br/>
   We saw Gypsum at Ubaldo’s yesterday, its structure seemed similar to it or to talk as Ubaldo’s suggested. we want to find out whether we could alternatively use talk.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   2)
   <strong>
    Mold dampness
   </strong>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Our sand was way too wet
   <br/>
   we learned so much by this experience. Jonah’s finely detailed model a very good example of what happens when a cast does not work when the mold is too wet: the silver was poured in, but it steamed so heavily that it did not fill up, but was forcefully flashing into the mold. It actually almost exploded into the sand.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   3)
   <strong>
    What is right temperature to pour?
   </strong>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   4)
   <strong>
    Sieve material
   </strong>
   <br/>
   the finer your sand is the bonding you get is better, we need finer sieves. In MS tammy cloth is mentioned, he also mentions making sieves from horse hair
   <br/>
   <br/>
   5)
   <strong>
    Appropriate pots
   </strong>
   <br/>
   We could try to find visual evidence of the right size of pots
   <br/>
   <br/>
   6)
   <strong>
    spirits
   </strong>
   <br/>
   we could do a control only with tap water to check what sal ammoniak and brandy does.
   <br/>
   We want to know sal ammoniak proportions and we need to research whether it reacts with the feather alum that we did not add, so it is difficult to decide now whether it has a function.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   7) does author of the MS
   <strong>
    reuse sand molds
   </strong>
   ?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   he does reuses plaster casts, but
   <br/>
   Our sand:
   <br/>
   Made out of previous molds.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   8)
   <strong>
    Material of the pattern.
   </strong>
   Is he using a medal metal?
   <br/>
   if the sand is intended for metal medals we might have reached a much better result t
   <br/>
   The earlier molds were made from sand called grog
   <br/>
   Grog is an inert sand silica that is very coarse but very fire resistant. Pamela and Tonny used it for their first molds
   <br/>
   <br/>
   9) what are the
   <strong>
    different materials that he used for sand
   </strong>
   and more specifically are there contemporary or earlier sources in which oil is used for sand preparations? Tonny could not find yet any pre 19th century sources where oil is used.
   <br/>
   Look for properties of the binders
   <br/>
   - look for references in the MS
   <br/>
   - other sources
   <br/>
   <br/>
   10)
   <strong>
    More experiments on the appropriate heating and drying of the molds
   </strong>
   <br/>
   Particular concern on how molds are heated and dried, spent specific attention to that in MS, also made a drawing of iron rods on which the molds have to be placed.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <strong>
    Observations on our sand:
   </strong>
   <br/>
   Only later they realized that MS said to use the ground tiles or bricks so the second patch of ground old molds was made from bricks and no grog.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The sand nearer the plaster molds felt different, indicating that the plaster molds sucked up the moist from the sand, because of which the impression also was not very good.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   MS he also was using all kind of different core materials composed of brick and feather alum.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Modern sand: has oil in it gets much blacker when smoked before pouring. Our sand was much less blackening, so it might be
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <strong>
    General observations:
   </strong>
   <br/>
   Many problems he is discussing in the other related passages are all problems we encountered and problems that lie on our table now, the author must have gone through these phases
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Developing attention, you learn what to pay attention to.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   ‘Sprinkling with charcoal to get rid of the oil fat’: where does the fat come from?
   <br/>
   To make your pattern less sticky, less adhesive to the sand, charcoal as release agent.
   <br/>
   Unctuous as property of fat, introducing something dry to counteract it.
   <br/>
   Bringing into balance.
   <br/>
   Fat and lean, pre Aristotelian, has to refer to agriculture.
   <br/>
   Other system not Aristotelian elements.
   <br/>
   To get a 100% clean release.

   Type of attention and receptivity

   Humility and receptivity
   <br/>
   Two way attention
   <br/>
   How we experienced how other molds

   Question: is our author a professional who can make a living from his experiments? Is he a scholar or a commercial producers, he is going through the learning process, he seems to be inte
