     SUBJECT: finishing the mold and casting in tin
    </strong>
   </h3>
   <br/>
   - Reset the humidifier station, began to humidify the commercial version.
   <br/>
   - Regrind the home made sand twice (altogether it is ground three times.)
   <br/>
   - the home made sand feels like beach sand, and forms a “sand castle” which takes the form and the detail of the cup well.
   <br/>
   - there is a huge difference in terms of the texture between the twice ground homemade sand and the thrice ground homemade sand. Maybe three is the magic number.
   <br/>
   - regrind the commercial sand once to make sure it is fine enough, as the salt is still quite granular.
   <br/>

    <li>
     <span class="s1">
      - some tin flows out form the space between the two parts of the mold.
     </span>
    </li>
    <li>
     <span class="s1">
      - The tin comes out cleanly. The cast gets the “K” pattern on the key.
     </span>
    </li>
    <li>
     <span class="s1">
      - The surface is not very smooth due to the coarse of the sand.
     </span>
    </li>
    <li>
     <span class="s1">
      - Surprisingly, although we thought the sand will fall apart after casting, actually it forms a very hard mold when it has dried out. As hard as cement.

      Mold 2: homemade sand, portrait metal,
     </span>
     <span class="s4" style="line-height: 1.5;">
      remoistened/reground on 12/9
     </span>
     <span style="line-height: 1.5;">
      , cast in tin, one side, mason jar lid. wait to dry,
     </span>
    </li>
    <li>
     <span style="line-height: 1.5;">
      - Due the result of cast 3, we decide that we should cast in tin instead of sulfur.
     </span>
    </li>
    <li>
     <span style="line-height: 1.5;">
      - We tried Brandy but it does not work out. So we decide to use charcoal instead of Brandy.
     </span>
    </li>
    <li>
     <span style="line-height: 1.5;">
      - Michelle and Yijun pack the sand in the mason jar with the portrait metal at the bottom. The portrait metal is dusted with charcoal.
     </span>
    </li>
    <li>
     <span style="line-height: 1.5;">
      - When we try to fill in the mold, the frame slippers around.
     </span>
    </li>
    <li>
     <span style="line-height: 1.5;">
      - When we try to flit the mold and remove the portrait metal, the metal drops.
     </span>
    </li>
    <li>
     <span style="line-height: 1.5;">
      - Michelle pours tin in the mold.
     </span>
    </li>
    <li>
     <span style="line-height: 1.5;">
      - The tin mold gets almost all the details, but not as good as the commercial one. It might because the homemade sand is less fine than the commercial one, or it might be because the homemade sand is dryer than the commercial one, or it might be because the mold slippered around when we fill in the mold with sand.
     </span>
    </li>
    <li>
     <span style="line-height: 1.5;">
      - Some black stains remains on the tin cast. Might be flux?
     </span>
    </li>
   </ul>
   <br/>
   <ul>
    <li>
     <span style="line-height: 1.5;">
      Mold 3: commercial sand, wet,
     </span>
     <span class="s4" style="line-height: 1.5;">
      remoistened/reground on 12/9,
     </span>
     <span style="line-height: 1.5;">
      cast in sulfur, one side, mason jar lid
     </span>
    </li>
    <li>
     <span style="line-height: 1.5;">
      - press the shell in and pack the sand. The sand becomes so hard that Michelle breaks the shell when trying to make an impression
     </span>
    </li>
    <li>
     <span style="line-height: 1.5;">
      - we try another shell. We fill in the shell with sand and put the shell and the bottom of the frame. Then we pack the frame with sand like what we did with sand box molding. Then Diana removes the shell from the sand.
     </span>
    </li>
    <li>
     <span style="line-height: 1.5;">
      - it is bad idea to cast in sulfur because the sand sticks to the sulfur and cannot be cleaned
     </span>
    </li>
   </ul>
   <br/>
   <ul>
    <li>
     <span style="line-height: 1.5;">
      Mold 4: sand mold with our magistry and sand that we used last time, double side, wooden frame box.
     </span>
    </li>
    <li>
     <span style="line-height: 1.5;">
      - we use two claps to tighten the mold,
     </span>
    </li>
    <li>
     <span style="line-height: 1.5;">
      - we put the mold in hood with an angle.
     </span>
    </li>
    <li>
     <span style="line-height: 1.5;">
      - Michelle pours tin in the mold.
     </span>
    </li>
    <li>
     <span style="line-height: 1.5;">
      - The tin comes out cleanly in gold. Prof. Smith thinks it is due to the salt we used in our binder/magistry.
     </span>
    </li>
    <li>
     <span style="line-height: 1.5;">
      - The sand mold still holds pretty well. So the magistry can be considered successfully but not for casting in tin.
     </span>
    </li>
   </ul>
   <br/>
   <ul>
    <li>
     <span style="line-height: 1.5;">
      Mold 5: commercial sand, sea shell,
     </span>
     <span class="s4" style="line-height: 1.5;">
      remoistened/reground on 12/9,
     </span>
     <span style="line-height: 1.5;">
      cast in tin, one side, mason jar lid. wait to dry
     </span>
    </li>
    <li>
     <span style="line-height: 1.5;">
      - Diana fills in the mason jar lid with sand, then dig a hole in the sand and presses the sea shell in to make an impression.
     </span>
    </li>
    <li>
     <span style="line-height: 1.5;">
      - Then she uses Brandy to moisten the sand so that we can separate the two halves of the mold without breaking the patten in the mold. Diana also moisten the pattern.
     </span>
    </li>
    <li>
     <span style="line-height: 1.5;">
      - It doesn’t work out. The sand is too wet and sticks together when we tries to separate the mold.
     </span>
    </li>
    <li>
     <span style="line-height: 1.5;">
      - This time Diana uses charcoal instead of Brandy.
     </span>
    </li>
    <li>
     <span style="line-height: 1.5;">
      - dusts the charcoal over the shell and over the surface between the two halves.
     </span>
    </li>
    <li>
     <span style="line-height: 1.5;">
      - The sand needs to be ground again after being packed into the mold because the sand hardened so fast after being pressed into the mold.
     </span>
    </li>
    <li>
     <span style="line-height: 1.5;">
      - Charcoal works really well.
     </span>
    </li>
    <li>
     <span style="line-height: 1.5;">
      - Michelle pours the tin into the mold. Totally safe, nothing happened.
     </span>
    </li>
   </ul>
   <br/>
   <ul>
    <li>
     <span style="line-height: 1.5;">
      Mold 6: commercial sand, portrait metal,
     </span>
     <span class="s4" style="line-height: 1.5;">
      remoistened/reground on 12/9,
     </span>
     <span style="line-height: 1.5;">
      cast in tin, one side, mason jar lid. wait to dry
     </span>
    </li>
    <li>
     <span style="line-height: 1.5;">
      - Diana packs the sand in the mason jar with the portrait metal at the bottom. The portrait metal is dusted with charcoal.
     </span>
    </li>
    <li>
     <span style="line-height: 1.5;">
      - Blows the mold with the torch.
     </span>
    </li>
    <li>
     <span style="line-height: 1.5;">
      - Michelle pours tin in the mold.
     </span>
    </li>
    <li>
     <span style="line-height: 1.5;">
      - The tin comes out cleanly and gets all the details of the portrait metal including the feathers of the eagle.
     </span>
    </li>
   </ul>
   <br/>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Mold 7: homemade sand thrice ground, same portrait metal, cast in tin, one side, mason jar lid.
     <strong>
      *I think mold 7 is mold 2. I made a mistake. (Yijun Wang)
     </strong>
    </li>
    <li>
     Yijun and Michelle pack the sand into the mason jar with the portrait metal at the bottom. the portrait metal had been generously dusted with charcoal before being packed with sand
    </li>
    <li>
     curiously enough, the metal falls right out of the sand when Yijun and Michelle turn over the sand, though the impression turns out well enough. was wary of this and redo the impression once more. however, it again falls right out when the mold is lifted. the impression is well done, however, and so we decide that it is good for casting
    </li>
    <li>
     quickly heat up the surface of the mold with the blow torch, then melt tin and pour
    </li>
    <li>
     the tin metal comes out very cleanly and also picks up quite a few of the detail, though some of the letters do not come out due to the impression/also the metal was not completely poured all the way to the rim.
    </li>
   </ul>

   <br/>
   <br/>
   Conclusion: the detail of the metals were very impressive. we had chosen a metal that had quite a bit of small, fine details, and almost all of them were picked up by both the commercial and homemade sand. if compared, we would say that the commercial picked up slightly more detail than the homemade, but we believe that could be due to the fact that the homemade sand was more dry when we casted the metal than the commercial sand. also, it is important to note that none of the molds steamed or ruined the metals when we poured tin, even right after making the molds. we believe this is most likely due to it being one sided molds, but nonetheless the fact that no steaming or reaction with water happened, even with damp molds, is noteworthy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   also: when we casted the mold that we had left to dry the previous day (mold #1), it actually casted very well, and the ventilation/drain system did work, despite some concern. though there was some filing and finishing that needed to be done from the excess that ran off the edges, we still got a surprisingly good impression for such a coarse sand, with much of the detail intact. we also found that the whole cast of the key was sort of bumpy, and we found that that is due to the coarser texture of the sand; the thrice-ground sand did not create a rough texture on the metal at all, so this indicates a great importance for well ground/finely ground sand.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   one more thing: we found that the sand in mold #1 was ROCK solid. we were very surprised, because when we were packing the sand while wet, we all had many concerns about whether or not the sand would even hold when it dried out. however, it was so strongly bound together after being completely dried. something happened chemically to make it so solid, after being so loose while wet! we look forward to seeing if the other molds will be just as hard when we leave them to dry.

    Finishing the mold
   </h3>
   <br/>
   Prep &amp; execution
   <br/>
   <ul>
    <li>
     prepared two white flat ceramic plates, one for the rock salt and homemade bone ash mixture and one for the rock salt and commercial bone ash mixture - in each plate:
     <ul>
      <li>
       folded piece of linen (so it's double-thick), wet with water and squeezed out so that it doesn't drip, folded around a piece of paper drizzled with water, folded around a layer of our mold material spread out as wide as possible on the plate
      </li>
      <li>
       each piece of linen is marked: "HOMEMADE" or "COMMERCIAL," referring to the bone ash used
      </li>
      <li>
       we are using a humidifier to accelerate the process and to keep the bone ash in the lab (it is not safe to use at home)
      </li>
     </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
     placed HOMEMADE on improvised grill shelf system (see photo) so that it can receive the stream of moist air from the humidifier below - left the plate underneath to catch any dripping water
    </li>
    <li>
     placed COMMERCIAL nearby, so that it receives some of the vapor dropping down from the other bone ash above
     <ul>
      <li>
       left it like this for at least 5 hours
      </li>
     </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
     <span style="line-height: 1.5;">
      then took down HOMEMADE,
     </span>
     placed
     <span style="line-height: 1.5;">
      COMMERCIAL on top of makeshift shelf, in line of humidifier
     </span>
     <ul>
      <li>
       <span style="line-height: 1.5;">
        HOMEMADE is now damp and a slightly darker shade of gray
       </span>
      </li>
      <li>
       <span style="line-height: 1.5;">
        to Michelle's and Diana's gloved hands it felt exactly like wet beach sand -- seemingly too coarse to leave a good impression
       </span>
       <ul>
        <li>
         <span style="line-height: 1.5;">
          rock salt grains as still clearly visible, do not appear to have dissolved
         </span>
        </li>
       </ul>
      </li>
     </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
     <span style="line-height: 1.5;">
      packed HOMEMADE into tin can rims to make mold while still wet, using brandy to allow the pattern to separate from the mold and to allow the two mold halves to separate from each other
     </span>
    </li>
    <li>
     <span style="line-height: 1.5;">
      trial #1: ring - unsuccessful - part of the mold material from the top half stayed around the ring when the 2 halves were separated
     </span>
    </li>
    <li>
     <span style="line-height: 1.5;">
      trial #2: bike lock key was successful enough, but the sand is so grainy that it is hard to make out all the details and whether the sand picked up all of them. Diana and Michelle decide that this impression will be enough, since the objective is to see just how cleanly the impression will turn out once tin is poured.
     </span>
     <ul>
      <li>
       once we decide this impression is clean enough, we begin to create ventilation holes on the side that will pour, as well as a funnel for the metal to go through (since it is a cylinder frame).
      </li>
      <li>
       we then left the mold to dry in the hood. we decided not to pour tin or sulpher into the mold that day.
      </li>
     </ul>
    </li>

   12: 16 the smoke changes color from black to grey.
   <br/>
   Donna checked the inside and the interior was smoked.
   <br/>
   12:17 at 800 a gust of smoke comes out and a sound of a short and intense whuff. Yijun freaks out…
   <br/>
   12:19 much less smoke now

     The ends of the two long bones are made of spongy bone material and appear to be more porous and soft than the shaft of the bone. The spongy bone is separated from the hard bone by the epiphyseal plate, or growth plate, and at this juncture we see a layer of cartilage. In order to remove the cartilage, we snap off the ends of the bones by hand.
    </li>
    <li>
     Today, pushing a thumb into the spongy bone, it quickly took the imprint of the thumb. Seeing this softness we decided to discard the spongy bone material.
    </li>
    <li>
     We now have 3 cleaned long bones from the upper and lower arms.
    </li>
    <li>
     All long bones and hoof bones are in the oven again, drying at 200 F and then at 300F (to speed up the process).
    </li>
    <li>
     At 3:18 PM we turn off the oven. Some parts of the hoof bone turn grey.

    Calcination. Twenty kilograms of cattle bone were cleaned, all meat remnants, lipids and tendons being removed, and then dried in the sun for 2-3 days. Batches of 3 kg at a time were heated on the plate of a cross draft kiln with a thermocouple. Atmospheric air was flushed into the kiln chamber from room temperature for approximately 1 hour. Then the firing was stopped and the kiln-gate opened gradually to cool down. The process was performed at 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800°C for 1.5 - 2 hours. This yielded 6 batches of bone char weighing 1 kg each. The bone char was ground in a mortar and sieved to obtain 3 - 5 mm grain size. Conventional calcination. For comparison purposes bone char was also prepared as normally used in the ICOH defluoridator, i. e. calcined up to 500°C, then firing stopped.

    Bone char properties. The colours of the bone char batches were recorded. The defluoridation capability of the bone char batches was tested by placing 80 g in 3 plastic columns imitating defluoridators. The plastic column set-up is shown in Figure 1. The columns were loaded at the rates of 1 or 4 L/h using water containing respectively 2.56 and 2 mg fluoride/L. Treated water samples were collected every 5 respectively 10 minutes of filtration. The fluoride concentrations were measured using Ion Selective Electrode Orion 720A and Orion 720.

    "Real bone ash is obtained by calcining bone up to approximately 1100°C and then cooling and milling. This material is still manufactured today since some of its important properties are due to the unique cellular structure of bones that is preserved through calcination. Real bone ash has excellent non-wetting properties, it is chemically inert and free of organic matters and has very high heat transfer resistance."

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">
    Cortical bovine bones were collected from the local slaughter houses. The procured bone samples were cleaned using boiling method to remove organic substances and collagen. This was done to avoid soot formation in the ma- terial during the calcination process. Raw bone was boiled in water for 30 minutes at 99.5oC, and then the water was removed and the bones were washed using fresh water. This process was repeated trice until it yielded white and clean samples. Before boiling, the macroscopic adhering impuri- ties and substances, which include the ligaments and tissues that stick on the bone were shaved and removed. After boil- ing, the bone samples were sun-dried for 3 days. The dried cortical bone samples were cut into shape using hacksaw. The bone powders from cutting chip or sawdust were col- lected and used for this experiment.
   </span>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">
    The bone powders were calcined in a box furnace at the following temperatures: 700oC, 800oC, 900oC, 1000oC, and 1100oC; with a temperature rate of 5oC/min. The tempera- ture was maintained for 2 hours to remove the organic ma- trix. The bovine bone powders were cooled to room tem- perature by slow furnace cooling."

     5. Effect of the calcination temperature on the composition and microstructure of hydroxyapatite derived from human and animal bone, paper by M. Figueiredoa
    </strong>
   </span>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">
    "Abstract
   </span>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">
    The present work focus the study of cortical bone samples of different origins (human and animal) subjected to different calcination temperatures (600, 900 and 1200 °C) with regard to their chemical and structural properties. For that, not only standard techniques such as thermogravimetric analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy were used but also mercury intrusion porosimetry. The latter technique was applied to evaluate the effects of the temperature on the microstructure of the calcined samples regarding porosity and pore size distribution.
   </span>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">
    Although marked alterations in structure and mineralogy of the bone samples on heating were detected, these alterations were similar for each specimen. At 600 °C the organic component was removed and a carbonate apatite was obtained. At 900 °C, carbonate was no longer detected and traces of CaO were found at 1200 °C. Crystallinity degree and crystallite size progressively increased with the calcination temperature, contrary to porosity that strongly decreased at elevated temperatures. In fact, relatively to the control samples, a significant increase in porosity was found in samples calcined at 600 °C (reaching values around 50%). At higher temperatures, a dramatic decrease was observed, reaching, at 1200 °C, values comparable to those of the non-calcined bone.
   </span>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">
    2.1. Sample preparation
   </span>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">
    Hydroxyapatite derived from natural bone (femur diaphysis) of different origins (human, bovine and porcine) was obtained under similar processing conditions. The human bone used in this study was a biologically no longer active femur from a 39-year-old male donor, supplied by the bone bank of Coimbra University Hospital (Portugal) [28].
   </span>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">
    The fresh bones of each specimen were cut into smaller pieces and cleaned well to remove most adhering impurities. Afterwards, the bones were boiled in distilled water for 30 min for degreasing and easier removal of tissues and bone marrow. This procedure was repeated twice with fresh water. Each diaphysis was then transversely cut into 1.5 cm thickness slices and the trabecular bone inside was carefully removed to obtain only compact bone samples.
   </span>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">
    Subsequently, the bone samples were totally degreased through immersion in an alcohol series (ethanol at 70%, v/v), followed by washing with distilled water. Then they were kept in hydrogen peroxide (30%, v/v) for at least 48 h and rinsed again. Finally, they were stored in formaldeyde solution (4%, v/v) at 4 °C. Before use, the samples were thoroughly rinsed with distilled water and subsequently dried in a vacuum oven at 50 °C for 3 days. These dry bone samples represent the controls in this study.
   </span>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">
    Natural hydroxyapatite was obtained after calcination of the human, bovine and porcine bone samples at 600, 900 and 1200 °C. These temperatures were selected after a preliminary thermogravimetric analysis. A systematic series of test samples was prepared by heating the bone slices in an electric furnace at each temperature for 18 h, under air atmosphere. After calcination, the samples were placed inside a desiccator at room temperature and naturally cooled.
   </span>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">
    Depending on the characterization techniques, samples were used as blocks (the whole slice/half-slice) or as particles (obtained by crushing the slices into smaller pieces and reducing the fragments to powder form by hand grinding in an agate mortar)."

    After receiving the 5 pound bulk bag from Amazon, we decided to grind the salt down a little more, as it was not quite fine enough and too granular. We ground it to a fine powder, but noticed that for whatever reason, the 5 pound salt was lighter in color and much drier than the rock salt we ground earlier in the week from Whole Foods. To our surprise, when we opened the jar of the Whole Foods salt once more, it was definitely "wetter" than the bulk salt, and easily stuck to itself; we can probably say it was quite "fatty" and not "lean." We postulate that this wetter quality is from the minerals contained in rock salt, but we are confused as to why the bulk sand doesn't share the same quality. Perhaps grinding it from larger chunks (since the Whole Foods jar of salt contained substantial pieces of salt that were not ground) contained the mineral content much better from already pulverized salt, or maybe the bulk salt is not true Himalayan rock salt?

    We began to grind the Himalayan rock salt purchased at Whole Foods, and it ground fairly well into a grainy powder. We were worried that we would not have enough from the jar that we purchased (the salt is quite expensive), and so Yijun found a bulk bag of finer Himalayan rock salt.

    Yijun and Michelle went to Whole Foods to purchase ingredients for the annotations. While there, we purchased whole pieces of Himalayan rock salt, cream of tartar, 100% concord grape juice, artisan white bread, and cheesecloth (the three last ingredients were for the mustard experiment). Since Whole Foods at Columbus Circle doesn't sell alcohol, a sweet red moscato wine was bought at a local liquor store afterwards.

    I pulverised them separately and ground them finely on the porphyry as much as I could. Then I mixed all of one with the other and re-ground it on the porphyry. Afterwards I moistened it in [a sheet of] paper folded in a moist napkin which is made wet more quickly from the moisture of the night, or the [moisture of] the cellar. I have never found [one] which can be removed more cleanly from the mold than this, though it needs to be quite moist. And if you want to cast small works, make it very hot. For tin, I believe that you cannot find a material that takes to powder better, and even for use withfine lead which has almost better results than tin. The bone of an ox hoof is always dry, that is why you must mix it with fatty sand, so it will bind like tripoli, salts, felt, ashes and similar materials. [If you do not mix ox-hoof bone,] it will not turn out from the mold and will not mold cleanly because it crumbles.

    Once you have molded, it is good to reheat your mold with the smoke of the material you are melting, because the cast would absorb the quality of the metal, then this metal will flow more easily in something thattakes after itself.

    Being well burned two times &amp; pulverized, they mold very cleanly as sand and do not need to be recooked, but just heated with the flame of straw. But if you are doing core molding, apply the first coat very thinly with your brush, and leave it to dry. Then strengthen the next coats with wadding mixed with this aforementioned sand of bone [hoof] dampened.

    After they have been dryly ground and beaten in the mortar, they are ground finely on the marble [slab]. I mixed the same quantity of each material, and in order to mix them better, I ground them on the porphyry [slab] again, and then filtered this through a double sieve or the sleeve of a shirt. Then, I put them on sheets of paper and stored it on a marble [slab] in a cellar. In one night, they were both moist enough [that there there was no need] to dampen them further because rock salt, like all other salts, dissolves in dampness. I molded with this very neatly because both should be quite fine. They should be moist enough so it can be removed easily [from the mold].

    Calcine the Oxe-bone in an ordinary fire, burn the Alum over a gentle fire till it be perfectly dry; then beat them together in a great Brass-Mortar, with the rest of the Ingredients, except the Mastich, which must be beaten apart; and having sifted the Powders thus prepar'd, mix them with the oyntment, stirring it till it be perfectly cold.

But if you examine all the Receipts, you shall find several mistakes that de|serve to be reform'd, and acknowledge that it was not done amiss, to produce a bet|ter, and more Methodical. The Astriction which the Ancients would give to the oyl, by washing it with Alum-water, cannot be very great, since the principal Astriction of the Alum lies in its terrestrerity, which never ascends in Distillation; and that the water drawn by that means alone, or in Distillation, is nothing but a flegm, which contains very little Spirit, and has no Astriction, neither in appearance, nor real. You shall also find, that the Astriction of Alum cannot be imparted to the oyntment, but by the

    The terrestrial and astringent part of the Oxe's Thigh-bone being only necessary for this oyntment, the dissipation of the flegm, spirit, salt, and volatile oyls is not regard|ded, no more then the consumption of the watry and spiritous parts of the Alum, since there is no need of the terrestrial.

    The Styptic oyntment apply'd to the Reins, strengthens them, as also the Ligaments of the Matrix, the descent whereof it hinders, and prevents abortion, anointing the entrance thereof, and the lower part of the Belly. It is also succesfully us'd to close the Neck of the Matrix after lying in, and to consolidate such tearings of the parts as hap|pen sometimes after difficult Labour. It is also very proper against the Relaxation of the streight Gut, apply'd without, and put into the Fundament, and to stop unreason|able losses of blood in Women, apply'd to the Region of the Reins, the Liver, and all the Belly: It is also laid upon the Stomach to stay vomiting. This oyntment causes no heat at all, and may serve in word upon all occasions where there is need of closing and consolidation.
