<br />
I had started a practice medallion in class trying to create a portrait of my dog's head. This was very difficult and I hadn't been sure of how to use the tools to get the kind of effects I wanted. I was not very happy with the results of this practice medal, which I had spent most of class making. I found that it was best to use a sharp tool and stick with it, using it carefully instead of using a wide range of tools that produce different effects. Over the course of carving my second medal, the honeybee, I really felt that I got to &quot;know&quot; my primary tool, a very sharp X-acto blade, and was able to use it with much more precision even than the wax carving tools that we had in the lab. When I picked up a new tool to work on my model, I would often be frustrated that it did not help me achieve the effect I wanted or was imprecise. The X-acto blade, while not ideal for carving in narrow crevices or other tools, became my go-to tool of choice. Even though it wasn't perfect for all situations, I had a sense of familiarity with this tool that made it easier to make shapes and forms more precisely.<br />
<br />
So when it came time to carve my final design, I had some experience with the tools and formulated a general plan for how I would go about carving. The temperature in the apartment was 80-81 degrees, making the wax soft and malleable---I didn't know the temperature of the lab, but the wax had seemed much harder when I had made my practice wax medal. I started by drawing a design into the wax surface, a little drawing of a honeybee. I remembered from the manuscript mentions of the importance of temperature in working with wax; I found that the warm temperature in my apartment made it easy to remove large amounts of wax at once, but more difficult to produce finer details.<br />
<br />
After making the initial design, I started to carve away the background of the image.<br />
<br />

<br />
The areas around the legs and antennae gave me the most trouble---it was very difficult to carve between the these small areas with my X-acto blade. It took a good deal of focus and patience (as well as steady hands) to remove this wax. I had to translate some elements from line drawing to a 3D relief design; for example, it was necessary to make the legs a good deal thicker in order to read on the object.<br />
<br />

<br />
After I had removed the background, I started to carve the body into relief. It was much more difficult than I expected to carve successfully in low relief, so I started adding some wax back onto the model and carving it down again. Adding wax was easy in the warm apartment; but it was difficult to avoid making the wax look messy. Every mark I made in the wax made it ball up and shave off.<br />
<br />

<br />
After working more with the wax by carving, adding wax, and carving again, I got a basic shape that I was happy with. I was still feeling anxious about not being able to get the form to be as clean as I would like, but I thought that it was at least readable as a bee and that seemed like an accomplishment!<br />

<br />
<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Author: Emogene</span><br />
<br />
I had a couple more carving sessions working on my wax model before I was ready to cast it in plaster; I was careful to not make any undercuts in the surface so that the wax would not get &quot;hooked&quot; on the clay. This produced quite a bit of anxiety not only for me but for my classmates. I spent a significant amount of time filling in small gaps with small balls of wax and then smoothing it down with my X-acto blade. This step was much easier done at my warm apartment than in the lab; I tried filling in gaps in the lab and was quite frustrated that I could not easily &quot;adhere&quot; new wax to my model in the slightly cooler lab.<br />
<br />
I also changed some of the detail of my design to be more general rather than using lots of incised lines---again, I was hoping to avoid the undercutting issue.<br />
<br />
The time had come to cast our wax models in plaster, so Julianna and I first got fistfuls of wet clay, formed them into balls, and then pressed them gently onto plates. We then applied a layer of dish soap to our wax model as a releasing agent, and then pressed our models into the wet clay. Then, we gently fished out the models and cleaned up the impression. Though I had much anxiety about the undercutting, the clay was so soft that it filled in the extra spaces around the bee's legs and left a fine impression, which was easy to clean up. When I was trying to fish out the wax model with a sharp tool, I accidentally cut down into the clay. This was very easily mended by cleaning the mold gently with the wax carving tools.<br />

<br />
Very satisfied with the result, we began mixing the plaster with the help of Tonny Beentjes, our expert maker in residence. He mixed the plaster under the fume hood, using a sieve. A small amount of water (possibly 1-2 cups?) was poured into a bowl, and the plaster was added gradually. All the while, Tonny was monitoring the consistency of the plaster, which must be just thick enough. The final consistency poured into the molds was just thicker than pancake batter; if I can be specific, I would call it a Trader Joe's European Yogurt consistency. Here is a video of Tonny pouring the plaster into the molds.<br />

<br />
Tonny poured the plaster slowly, and then gently tapped the plates on which the molds were resting to help settle the plaster into the crevices of the molds.<br />

<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">On Tuesday, we came in and released our hardened plaster models from the clay. Julianna's model came out pretty easily from the clay, but mine was tough to remove. I cut through the cracks in the dried clay to try and weaken the stress points, and after doing this for 10-15 minutes I was able to start breaking away the clay and free my model. It took some effort! One of the bee's legs came off during the removal.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">We then set about refining our plaster models with sharp tools, files, and sand paper. The plaster felt rather soft to me, softer than expected, like chalk. I was able to clean up my surfaces really nicely and file the edges of the model to make them smooth and circular.</span><br />

<br />
After finishing our plaster models, we began to prepare our sand molds for casting. The first step in this process is to make the sand, for which we had powdered molds (previously ground by a mortar and pestle by our classmates), a water-ammonium-chloride solution, and a small bottle of brandy. The two latter ingredients we used as &quot;magistry&quot; to bind our molds together.<br />
<br />
There was a shortage of mixing bowls in the lab, so we watched carefully how the other groups were mixing their sand before we began. Most groups started with 3 1/2 cups of dry sand and then added a variable amount of the magistry to make the sand moist, but not wet. (See Julianna's notes for measurements &amp; quantities). We noted that it was very easy to make the sand too wet, and then groups would have to add more of the dry sand to compensate for sand that was too wet. The best sand seemed to be that that could be gathered into a small ball in your fist, but then easily crumbled by pinching it with your fingers. This was a very tricky task---it also seemed that the consistency changed before our eyes. Our station was underneath an air vent blowing warm air into the room, so the sand we worked with would dry out. When we got to the stage of pounding the sand into the mold (more on that process presently), we noticed that the sand seemed to become wetter, and the moisture came out of the sand and even made it muddy at times.<br />
<br />
We started with sand that had already been mixed by Ray and Jordan (thanks guys!). We understood the process of sand casting to be this:<br />
<br />
<ol><li>First, dust the plaster models lightly with powdered charcoal.</li><li>Set one half of the box mold on a clean surface. Position the metals facing up, in such a way that the molten metal will be able to flow from one to the other (we needed Tonny to verify our arrangement of medals; we ended up using a larger iron box frame to accommodate three medals in a pyramidal arrangement)</li><li>Sprinkle a layer of sand on top of the plaster models so that it just covers them.</li><li>With your hands, press the sand down firmly around the outside of the models, being careful not to displace the models as the sand is compressed. The aim here is to build a solid foundation to keep the medals from moving in the model---the edges around the medals themselves are much more important to pack in than the edges of the box frame. Build this layer up to be the same height as the medals, but do not cover the medals yet.</li><li>With the medals secure, sprinkle more sand on top of the medals and press down firmly---the impression of the medal is the most important area here. You want to be sure to get the best impression possible.</li><li>Keep packing in sand until you fill the box mold. Then, using a rubber mallet, gently pound the sand into the mold.</li><li>Use a knife or sharp edge to level the sand smoothly on top of the mold.</li><li>Flip the mold over, so the backs of the plaster models are facing up. Brush the whole surface generously with charcoal.</li><li>Put the other half of the box mold on top; if the two halves do not fit securely together, make impression &quot;keys&quot; in the sand itself to help with alignment</li><li>Fill the other half with sand, sprinkling and packing it in. Once the second half of the box mold has been filled, pound the sand and level it with a straight edge or knife.</li><li>Let both halves of the mold dry; before the molds dry completely (Tonny did this step for us), carve out a network of channels to pour in the molten metal.</li></ol><br />
Observations from going through this process:<br />
<ul><li>We had to mix sand several times to fill our box mold---we used a mold that was a bit larger than the other smaller wooden ones. While we were mixing sand, the packed sand in our mold would dry a bit (again, our work station was under an air vent). Mixing sand each time got a little easier, but it was still very challenging to get the right consistency.</li><li>We packed our mold very tightly. We were impressed with how hard the sand felt to the touch when it was being packed down.</li><li>When pounding sand in our mold, we observed that the moisture comes out of the sand and makes the sand muddy. We were advised to sprinkle a generous amount of dry sand on top of this muddy layer to absorb the moisture. This seemed to work well for improving the texture of the wet sand in the mold.</li></ul><br />

<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">We had a discussion about assumptions and grogg (inert sand that makes it resist fire), the molds that we used were from previous experiments that used commercial sand. Some hypothesize that the reason ti came out well was the pressed patterns into the clay (although this was disputed in the debrief the day after, post --examination of results)</span><br />
<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Hardwood charcoal - oak and other woods.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Rosin is added and stirred into molten tin. </span><br />

There was an opportunity to examine many ingredients/materials that Ubaldo put out on display for us including a selection of wax mixtures.<br />

<br />
<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Ubaldo heated up the silver in a separate furnace, and we placed our molds ready for the pour.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">We hear the loud sounds of air. During the pour is the explosion. Why? feather alum issue? Wet molds? Ubaldo places a rock over the opening to decrease oxygen and put out the fire.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">The steam pushes everything out. Once they cool down, tin was poured in afterwards in an attempt to salvage medallion construction.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Once the molten silver was added, sparks flew in the air and the mold caught fire! (presumably due to excess moisture)</span><br />

<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Ubaldo's second talk &quot;toilet seat analysis&quot; ; smell of metal, the color of the stone, the taste.</span><br />
<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">After the discussion we opened up our (now) cooled off molds. See results below.</span><br />

<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">DATE AND TIME: 10/17/14 10:50am</span><br />
<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">LOCATION: 560 Chandler (lab)</span><br />
<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">SUBJECT: Notes from class discussion</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">pewter medal</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">don’t cut off the gate because it makes it easier to handle</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">it would then be filed with a coarse file</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">pewter is a softer metal, but it is sticky, somewhat viscous</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">flashing;</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">chasing - small punches, blunt chisels — push the material, more dfinition. chaser would have 100s of different tools</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">engraving - more detail</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">filling</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">not much mention of chasing in the manuscript</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">ideal of a founder: no chasing work is needed after casting</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">matter of pride; 19th c. “cast from one piece without chasing”</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">life casting — this would be an area that chasing would not be ideal</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">pewter with small percentage of silver</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">alloy</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">atinmony and copper</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">dissimilar to what manuscript writer was using</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">he was probably using led</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">more pressure in the mold — make the gate larger</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">metalcasting is not really about the metal — it’s about the mold</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">it’s about the sand</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">our sand was not as good as the delft sand</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">consistency of wax pattern — harder produces more detail</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">coins are struck, milled</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">metal is hard</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">force</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">anneal - heating the metal to a point where the metal is “relaxed”</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">working with it, it gets harder and harder, it gets brittle</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">then you need to relax it</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">tacit knowledge — sensory information of the metal</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">when you anneal the silver, it turns black — this is the copper oxidizing</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">10% sulfuric in water - “the pickle”</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">soak it, and it comes out white</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">it takes off the oxide layer</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">if you’ve done soldering, it helps the flux</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">borax as a flux: late medieval sources</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">(check in theophilus)</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">table salt as a flux</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">silver, copper, bronze</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">tin is lower range - use more resin-type fluxes (sheep’s fat, other greasy types of flux)</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">soldering - hydrochloric acid saturated with zinc</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">manuscript: “a secret” — is this a flux</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">rosin was the flux to clean the surface</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">binds with the oxide, oxide layer refers to as scum</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">used for future oxidation as well</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">solder won’t adhere if the surface is dirty</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">flux: use it to clean the layer of oxide off molten metal</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">also used in soldering,</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">sal ammoniac/ammonium chloride</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">why? we don’t know exactly</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">possibly: it acts as a flux</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">might help prevent a buildup of oxidizing</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">you don’t need a pickle for tin</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px;">&quot;The same sand which has been used in composed heated cores, i.e. of plaster, brick and feather alum, is excellent for casting in box molds, and I have tried it as follows. I crushed the pieces which had come out of core molds in a mortar, pestling slowly, because this sand is very soft. I did not pass it through a sieve, because the feather alum mixed in, which makes it bind together, would not pass through.&quot;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px;">1. we did not use “feather alum” because we think that this is asbestos.</span><br />
<br />
<ul><li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">we need to make a study of what feather alum is and its properties are.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">maybe we could use talc?</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">gypsum is a calcium hydrate; feather alum can be several different chemical compounds</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">sulfates to try out the clay: cornstarch?</span></li></ul><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px;">2. drying the molds: biggest problem was that our molds were wet</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px;">3. what is the temperature to pour metal</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px;">4. grinding</span><br />
<br />
<ul><li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">the finer your sand is, the better</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">&quot;But I did refine upon marble what seemed to me too coarse, and having thus prepared it”</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">we need to make finer sieves</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">horsehair sieve, tammy cloths (tamis in French)</span></li></ul><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px;">5. proportions of sal ammoniac?</span><br />
<br />
<ul><li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">could we look for illustrations of workshops and see the size of the pots?</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">it might not be as big of a deal</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">controlled experiments: we shouldn’t write off the sal ammoniac yet because we haven’t used the feather alum</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">maybe we should look at barley recipes to determine the size of the barley-boiling-bottle</span></li></ul><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px;">6. what was in the sand?</span><br />
<br />
<ul><li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">made of previous molds</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">grog - additive used now, make the molds resist the heat</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">fire resistant</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">manuscript: ground bricks</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">probably replicating other medals, already in metals</span></li></ul><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px;">7. does he reuse sand molds?</span><br />
<br />
<ul><li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">the oil-based delft sand — probably can’t reuse it, because it burns</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">the other molds (no oil) could be used again, didn’t burn out</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">look for references in the manuscript and other sources</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">are there references to using oil?</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">how does he describe the properties of the binders</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">can we re-use any of these molds?</span></li></ul><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px;">8. does he mold after existing medals? might say something about his profession.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px;">9. could we experiment with drying the molds? “make them ring”? the drawing shows particular concern for drying the molds.</span><br />
<br />
<ul><li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">experience is helping us sharpen our attention to the text</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">but there is a lot of repetition</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">for the “doer”</span></li></ul><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px;">&quot;Having thus moistened the sand in order to give it a nice hold, though it still came apart easily, I sprinkled my medal with charcoal pulverized with a file to remove the oil fat, and all other fat”</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px;">What is the fat? </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px;">Tonny: perhaps this is the fat/oil from the fingers?</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px;">Make it less sticky</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px;">Tonny: empathy for materials</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px;">we have to work with the realities of the material</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px;">29r — concerns with costs</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px;">choosing recipes that may be able to used 2nd half of the semester</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px;">recipes that predate the manuscript that are similar</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px;">with french - can use any of those recipes</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px;">nature casting - has already been done</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px;">anything that is done with the molding</span><br />
