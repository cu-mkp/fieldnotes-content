   ] that are used for the loam compositions for making the moulds for casting bronze, brass, or other metals. Since this is a very necessary thing, you must try to have the best kind and one that resists the fire well. It must be disposed to receive the metals well, must make a neat casting, and must not shrink or break with cracks on drying or baking. (...)

   All earths are either sandy or tufaceous, either argillaceous and lean or pasty with unctuous viscosity. (...) the good ones must be those that are neither (...)." Go to mines, Speaks of colors as perhaps a measure of quality, Etc.
