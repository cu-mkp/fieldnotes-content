 The sensory cues that are absent from the written text but apparent/palpable in the reconstruction / in the doing:<br />
The sound of cocoa beans crunching crushing as you break the shells (notes transition phase)<br />
The smells of burnt chocolate, caramelized sugar, burnt/oxidized oils from nuts etc. that signal heat is too much!<br />
The visual and tactile cues when cacao bean nut mix is transitioning from powder to paste (with release of oils/fats)<br />

<span style="display: block; font-family: Arial; font-size: 20px; text-align: left;">•</span><span style="color: #000000; display: block; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 20px; text-align: left;">Cinnamon and long red pepper are first to be beaten with the anisseed</span><br />

(if you put too much fire, it will runne over and spoil) according to author this is not too wholesome though ti pleases the pallate.</span><br />

<strong>9/8/2014</strong><br />
<strong>Tablets dried overnight, batch 1 (with sugar) formed a loaf, batch 2 (tablet form) we attempted author's recommended prep of dissolving in hot water (we used 175 degrees for hot) and preferred amount of sugar (we used 1/2 teaspoon of sugar to one small table, and 2 oz. of hot water). to dissolve we used a wire whisk moving in the motions suggested by artistic representation of molinet . . .</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Next, come up with scaled batch recipe instructions for tomorrow:</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Scaled batch recipe :</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>scaled ingredient list to make enough for class</strong><br />
<strong>plan divide by 5</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>100 cacao beans = 50 cacao beans</strong><br />
<strong>2 cods of long red pepper = 1 cod of long red pepper</strong><br />
<strong>1 handful of aniseed = 0.5 handful of aniseed</strong><br />
<strong>2 flower of mecafuchil or 6 roses of Alexandria (if belly bound) = no bound bellies</strong><br />
<strong>1 cod campeche = safety and procurement concerns (consider alternate aromatic of fennel seed)</strong>*<br />
<strong>2 drams cinnamon = 1.772 grams of cinnamon</strong> note on drams<br />
12 almonds = 6 almonds<br />
12 hazel nuts = 6 hazelnuts<br />
1/2 lb of white sugar = 0.25 lb sugar = 113.398 grams<br />
enough achiote for color = enough powdered annatto for color ? weigh a pinch<br />
<br />

The Huskes or Cods of Logwood, or Campeche, are very good, and smell like Fennell; and every one puts in of these, because they are not very hot; though<br />
<span style="text-decoration: none;">it</span><br />
excuse not the putting in of Annis-seed, as sayes the Author of this Receipt; for there is no <em>Chocolate</em> without it, because it is good for many cold diseases, being hot in the third degree; and to temper the coldnesse of the <em>Cacao</em>; and that it may appeare, it helpes the indisposition of Cold parts, I will cite the Verses of one curious in this Art:&quot;from<br />
<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/21271/21271-h/21271-h.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.gutenberg.org/files/21271/21271-h/21271-h.htm</a> which appears to be expanded version of manuscript. but without a specific amount or weight we debated role of fennel (aromatic vs. functional ingredient in terms of oils/fats) both aniseed and fennel would impart a licorice type aromatic . . decided the role of campeche seems to be for coloring a reddish tint which the annatto is providing, issue of color importance! (perhaps communicate the other red ingredients which don't impart color - cinnamon and pepper?, red = chocolate = aphrodisiac)<br />

The word &quot;dram&quot; was borrowed from the Anglo-French and Late Latin word &quot;dragme,&quot; which was originally used for a silver coin used by the ancient Greeks (now known in English as the &quot;drachma&quot;) and for the coin's approximate weight. In the 16th century, English speakers also began using &quot;dram&quot; for a weight of fluid measure (also called a &quot;fluid dram&quot;) equal to 1/8 fluid ounce, and more loosely for any small portion of something to drink. &quot;Dram&quot; is also used figuratively for any small amount, in much the same way as &quot;grain&quot; and &quot;ounce.”) from <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/word/word.php?date=Aug-31-2010" rel="nofollow">http://www.merriam-webster.com/word/word.php?date=Aug-31-2010</a><br />
