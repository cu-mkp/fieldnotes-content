      Have some tragacanth gum and let it dip until it drinks all the water and is swollen and turned into jelly. Then grind it strongly on marble and then have some rye flour which is better than the wheat one for it is more humid and don’t make the batter so dry and spread your tragacanth gum and keep grinding and mingle little by little the very finely sieved flour and knead it

     <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;">
      you want to put in the oven. You can reckon when it can be stretched without breaking, and if it is not strong enough it can’t be well detached. After being so prepared, rub it with some cane oil with a brush so the oil soak into it to make it more detachable and press the batter strongly, if it is not well detachable, mix with some flour until it gets thick enough. With this, you can mould very neatly any work or masks or […] You wish which will be dry in one day. Then, apply some white glue or […] glue as you want, and you will be able to paint them, ornate them with gold and other colours. There are used as floor ornaments in Rome and they can be used as bed ornaments. If you to keep your work white, you‘d better mould some plaster rather than flour which is drier and firmer but you have to prepare that way : when it is in powder, soak it in good quantity of water so it is clear and grind it several times a day for 15 days, then pour some water by fits and starts and gather the plaster and finely grind it on marble, and put it in a lead and neat vessel in which mustn’t fall any dust or filth, and leave it still air-dry for a fortnight in its water, And it will become mat and very white and light, very appropriate for a base for brown gold. And this is the powder one you can mingle instead of flour with some tragacanth gum, and your work will be very beautiful. In the absence of plaster, you can mingle some well ground chalk or ceruse and try other similar matters. This tragacanth mingled stucco is typical for fitting on either round or flat things as you wish when it is pressed not completely dried. This is to make some bargain ornaments.

      Make an impression in colored wax of the relief of your medal. And you will get a hollow mold, in which you can throw en noyau a relief in sand. In this, you will cast your hollow in lead or tin. In this, you you will cast your wax relief.

     <span style="color: #323333; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px;">
      And then on this

       wax

      or
      <strong>
       silver

      <strong>
       But to make this process go faster, if you are in a hurry, make the first impression and the first hollow out of the inside portion of the

      And inside this, throw in the melted

       wax

      which will give you a nice relief on which you can make your noyau.

    p139v_b1a Take some
    <strong>
     white wax
    </strong>
    which is much more appropriate for this kind of work than anything else, because it is much firmer and does not leave as much filth, as much as you need to cast the animal that you propose, and no more. And [take] a half quantity of
    <strong>
     ground coal
    </strong>
    and neatly sieved through a cloth or coal sleeve, using it to give some color to your
    <strong>
     wax
    </strong>
    , that would otherwise be transparent and you will not be able to see your lines as clearly. Put your
    <strong>
     wax
    </strong>
    on the coal fire to melt. And when it is well-melted and well-liquified, take a full eared-porringer of melted wax, [and] as much
    <strong>
     sulphur
    </strong>
    as the amount of a large pulverized walnut. Melt all of over a slow fire and when it is melted, do not leave it on the fire because it will become too hot. But take it off and keep stirring it with a little stick and when it has finished bubbling and is as liquified as water, cast it into the
    <strong>
     wax
    </strong>
    that you will have previously removed from the fire. And mix and stir both of the them so that they join together. After stir in little by little while continuously mixing, the
    <strong>
     charcoal
    </strong>
    that has been repeatedly ground, and in this way it will be very well incorporated. This is how you will know that your
    <strong>
     wax
    </strong>
    has gone beyond its ideal heating point, it will release no more smoke, it will start to have lines appearing on the side and not in the middle, and those lines will be close to each other. If you cast too hot, you will not be able to separate your wax from your mold and it would stick to the cast. When it is at the right state, stir it with a little stick so that the pulverized
    <strong>
     charcoal
    </strong>
    is well mixed in and has not fallen to the bottom of the mixture. And in this way, throw it in your mold bit by bit and not in one go, because
    <strong>
     wax
    </strong>
    is not runny.&lt;/ab&gt;

    p139v_c1a This black sulphured

    is for fashioning round figures that do not come out of the mold. And they need to be burned in the moule au noyau rather than be opened like the ones that have something jutting out or an intertwining of legs and arms. And this
    <strong>
     wax
    </strong>
    , thanks to the
    <strong>
     sulphur,
    </strong>
    will melt with little heat and leave without leaving any filth. If by some misfortune the crushed
    <strong>
     charcoal
    </strong>
    remains in ashes, when you open the mold and blow on it, it will come clean.&lt;/note&gt;

    When you want to cast in
    <strong>
     wax
    </strong>
    in a
    <strong>
     plaster
    </strong>
    mold, you must know this secret, that there is need that your mold be in
    <strong>
     hot water
    </strong>
    . The animal will never come out as clean as in metal, because
    <strong>
     wax
    </strong>
    grips. But to rough out an animal as close to natural as possible in order to fix it afterwards, you have to remove all the scales, because the
    <strong>
     wax
    </strong>
    will permeate them &amp; will not be able to be stripped off. In molding the animal, take off the scales for
    <strong>
     wax
    </strong>
    , but on the contrary [when not molding with wax] rub them against their grain so that they raise up, because then these animals [sc. those not molded in wax and prepared in this way] will show better. Do not wait to strip off your wax until it is cooled down at all. But while it is a bit hot, after you have molded the first casting of the animal, uncover it halfway so that it be stripped in so doing. And having as much in one mold as in the other, make very many large castings holding on to the animal in order to fortify them [...] stripping, &amp; afterwards you’ll cut it.

   </ul>
   <br/>
   &lt;ab id=”p012r_b1”&gt;
   <strong>
    Sulfur
   </strong>
   is improved by mixing in
   <strong>
    soot black
   </strong>
   or powdered
   <strong>
    sanguine
   </strong>
   , which makes it harder and more resistant, after letting it melt entirely until it becomes liquid and similar to oil. Mixing it with
   <strong>
    verdigris
   </strong>
   , you can use it for casting a lizard or something else in
   <strong>
    plaster
   </strong>
   , very cleanly.&lt;/ab&gt;
   <br/>
   &lt;note id=”p012r_c1”&gt;You must not cast it until it has quite down and lost all its bubbles and eyes, and its surface has fallen and become flat as water.
   <strong>
    Soot black
   </strong>
   gives it a fine luster and makes it neater. Use
   <strong>
    yellow sulfur
   </strong>
   of the best kind, as the
   <strong>
    greyish
   </strong>
   <strong>
    natural
   </strong>
   <strong>
    sulfur
   </strong>
   is no good. Don’t cast it in the wind and cold for it would fill with bubbles.&lt;/note&gt;
   <br/>

   &lt;ab id=“p140v_b1”&gt;
   <br/>
   To make a clean cast in
   <strong>
    sulfur
   </strong>
   , arrange the pith of some
   <strong>
    bread
   </strong>
   under the brazier, as you know how to do. Mold whatever you want &amp; leave it to dry &amp; you will have a very clean work.&lt;/ab&gt;
   <br/>
   <br/>
   &lt;note id=“p140v_c1”&gt;
   <br/>
   Try
   <strong>
    sulfur
   </strong>
   passed through melted
   <strong>
    wax
   </strong>
   , since it won’t catch fire &amp; won’t make more little eyes.&lt;/note&gt;

     &lt;title id=”p043r_a3”&gt;

     &lt;/title&gt;
    </li>
   </ul>
   <br/>
   &lt;ab id=”p043r_b3”&gt;Take half an ounce of soft
   <strong>
    tin
   </strong>
   , melt it in a spoon. Once it is melted, throw in an
   <span class="s1">
    ℥
   </span>
   of
   <span class="s2">
    ☿
   </span>
   , mix together. Once they are cold, grind on a
   <strong>
    porphyry
   </strong>
   slab. Then take an
   <span class="s1">
    ℥
   </span>
   of
   <strong>
    sal ammoniac
   </strong>
   and an
   <span class="s1">
    ℥
   </span>
   of the yellowest
   <strong>
    sulfur
   </strong>
   that may be found, grind both. And then mix very well all the aforementioned materials. Then put all together into a glasssublimatorium. Hold this over a small fire for an hour, and for an hour over a stronger fire, and for an hour over a very strong fire, and it will be ready. Then, to use it, apply
   <strong>
    resin black
   </strong>
   with the
   <strong>
    glue
   </strong>
   used by
   <em>
    painters
   </em>
   to paint, two or three times, until it is quite black. Then apply a bit of
   <strong>
    varnish
   </strong>
   . Once it is dry, apply the
   <strong>
    purpurine
   </strong>
   dry with a finger where you want. The more you apply, the finer it will look. Then, if you like, you can apply
   <strong>
    varnish
   </strong>
   on top.&lt;/ab&gt;

   DELIGHT IN GROTTOES (art/nature orientation)

   <strong>
    Charcoal

   , the work of
   <strong>
    tin
   </strong>
   , and pure
   <strong>
    brass

   .
   <strong>
    Paper
   </strong>
   ground up and mixed with ground up
   <strong>
    glass
   </strong>
   .
   <strong>
    Cork
   </strong>
   . Heated
   <strong>
    parchment
   </strong>
   , white
   <strong>
    coral
   </strong>
   . All of them are appropriate for making grottoes. But, once dry, bizarre pieces of
   <strong>
    wood
   </strong>
   , which are found in the forests and among [regular] mushrooms and large mushrooms [growing on] trees, are better than all of them because they are light. Mix in with small pieces of
   <strong>
    looking-glass tin
   </strong>
   which have a shiny luster. Grind in a little [bit] of a different kind of
   <span class="s3">
    <strong>
     marcasite
    </strong>
   </span>
   in order to clean the
   <strong>
    earth
   </strong>
   away, then powder the work, which is very beautiful. If there is no spring in the grotto, glue all of this with strong
   <strong>
    glue
   </strong>
   , and then the work is done. You must show all kinds of
   <strong>
    mines
   </strong>
   . The
   <strong>
    sulfur
   </strong>
   ous
   <strong>
    marcasites
   </strong>
   which do not have a grain but are even like
   <strong>
    looking-glass tin
   </strong>
   are very beautiful.&lt;/ab&gt;

    SUBJECT: Cast wax in breadmold
   </span>
   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: Wingdings;">

   </span>
   Only two of our mold left. The fish one broke.
   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: Wingdings;">

   </span>
   Prof. Smith heated the 100% beeswax on an electronic stove with a pan with enamel surface
   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: Wingdings;">
    l
   </span>
   We poured wax into our breadmold
   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: Wingdings;">
    n
   </span>
   The scissor mold turned out to be leaking. Diana built a wall with wax to prevent leaking
   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: Wingdings;">
    n
   </span>
   The shell mold was leaking too since there was cracks on the bottom. We couldn’t really fill the mold full with wax.

   RESULT DISCUSSION
   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: Wingdings;">
    l
   </span>
   Our bread mold was not so successful
   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: Wingdings;">
    l
   </span>
   The cracks in the bread turned out to be the reason for leaking. The cracks started to appear since the bread was dried out. So probably the bread should be fresh when used for making molds.
   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: Wingdings;">
    l
   </span>
   We shouldn’t get the inside part out and remake it a flatter surface. This action also caused cracks. We should cut the bread directly and cast/press the metal at the beginning.
   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: Wingdings;">
    l
   </span>
   Other groups working with white bread had better results. So whole wheat may not be a good choice.
