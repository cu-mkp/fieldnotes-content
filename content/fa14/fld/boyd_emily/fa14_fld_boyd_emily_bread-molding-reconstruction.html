   <br/>
   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12px;">
    Using two-part mold, we cut a somewhat larger gate in the place in which we started cutting the previous day. After some deliberation about what material to use for our cast, and having seen other results, we decided that the best detail and release we could get was in sulfur. We considered doing a wax-sulfur mixture, but that did not mix well; as well as sulfur mixed with charcoal, as is suggested in some of the recipes, but we did not have charcoal currently available. Our main purpose in this experiment was less to experiment with casting materials than to attempt a two-part mold.
   </span>
   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12px;">
    The mold did not look like it would sustain the level of detail of the original pattern. In addition to being moldy, the two parts had cracked and warped, so we taped the two parts together for extra pressure to prevent leakage, although we are not sure if that had any effect.
   </span>
   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12px;">
    Propping the two-part mold on a paper cup in the fume hood with the hole facing upwards, Joel Klein melted sulfur and then poured the molten sulfur into the mold. The original amount of sulfur that we prepared did not fill the mold in its entirety, so we had to melt some more. Upon first observation, this break in pouring was not visible in the final product.
   </span>
   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12px;">
    After about half an hour, Joel broke away the bread from the solidified sulfur. The result was far more detailed than we expected.

    Rye bread, dark in color, with pith pressed around small Buddha figurine in two parts. In order to register the two parts' placement with respect to one another, we stuck two yellow lead pencils through both halves of the mold. By this time the mold was moldy on one side (the side it had been lying on). We met to carve out a gate in which to pour material in a place in the bread mold that had already had a small crack at the foot of the figurine, near the base. We placed the mold in a refrigerator to prevent further molding for the next day and a half.

   I. The first experiment with soaking our bread mold in order to take out the wax model resulted in a somewhat satisfactory result. We let it sit in the water overnight -- in the morning the bread broke away relatively easily, but there did seem to be a risk of cracking or changing the shape of the wax - especially the thinner parts (the outer edges). Some small dough-parts are still stuck on to the wax model. The details of the original object used to mold have kept their shape relatively well - at least in those parts that were molded properly (as mentioned before this was not our best mold).
   <br/>

   <br/>
   <br/>
   II. With the second, the better mold, we decided to use the soaking-method again, but this time for a longer period of time - in order to see whether the bread would come off more easily, and more completely. This time we soaked it for over 24 hours - until the bread had already seemed to let loose for the largest part (see images). The method seems to have worked. The imprint of the object is rendered beautifully on both the bread mold and the wax. Small pieces of dough, however, still are stuck to the wax, so we put the wax model back into a bowl of water to see whether these parts will come off themselves.

   <br/>
   Recommendations/Questions for future use of the bread molding method:
   <br/>
   - Use one large piece of hot bread 'pith' in order to prevent cracks and holes
   <br/>
   - Would it prevent the dough from sticking to the wax when the bread mold is oiled/greased slightly before pouring the wax in?
   <br/>
   - The holes/cracks in our mold resulted in some wax seeping away - which caused some very shallow and thus fragile parts of the wax model
   <br/>

   Our aim tonight is to take the casted bees wax out of the bread molds. We have two filled molds.
   <br/>
   1. The wax has hardened all day after casting in class this morning
   <br/>
   2. We soaked mold nr. 1 (which was cast secondly) to see how the mold and the wax would respond to the water.
   <br/>
   After 5 min. soaking most of the bread was still like a rock - only the outside of it seems to start to dissolve a little - and trying to take it off the beeswax seems to cause the wax to break.
   <br/>
   3. After 10 min. - bread is getting softer, but it will probably take a long time, so we decided to leave it overnight and look tomorrow morning

    Start with sourdough starter &amp; rye starter - difficult to find modern recipes that don't include dry yeast
   </span>
   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12px;">
    Starters look foamy, rye started is noticeably darker than regular sourdough starter; smell very sour
   </span>
   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12px;">
    Plan to use two recipes, make four molds, experiment with molding top and bottom of objects

   </span>
   <br/>
   <span style="color: #929292; font-family: Arial; font-size: 10px;">
    225g / 8 oz rye flour
   </span>
   <br/>
   <span style="color: #929292; font-family: Arial; font-size: 10px;">
    9g / 1/3 oz salt
   </span>
   <br/>
   <span style="color: #929292; font-family: Arial; font-size: 10px;">
    285g/ 10 oz sourdough starter
   </span>
   <br/>
   <span style="color: #929292; font-family: Arial; font-size: 10px;">
    Warm water to mix
   </span>
   <br/>
   <span style="color: #929292; font-family: Arial; font-size: 10px;">
    Olive oil
   </span>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <span style="color: #929292; font-family: Arial; font-size: 10px;">
    Place both flours into a large baking bowl, add the salt and mix together. Make a large well in the centre and add the starter dough. Using a fork, draw the flour into the centre and mix lightly. Then (I like to use my hands) mix the starter and flour and water a little at a time together to create a sticky dough.
   </span>
   <br/>
   <span style="color: #929292; font-family: Arial; font-size: 10px;">
    Either knead the bread in a mixer with a dough hook, or, tip the dough onto a lightly floured work top and knead until you have a smooth, elastic dough. If the dough is dry, add more water, too wet and you will need to sprinkle with a little flour. This will take about 10 minutes in the machine, 12 – 15 by hand.
   </span>
   <br/>
   <span style="color: #929292; font-family: Arial; font-size: 10px;">
    Once the dough is ready, lightly oil a mixing bowl with a little olive oil. Tip the dough into the bowl, cover with cling film / saran wrap and put the bowl in a cool, not cold and draught-free place. Leave for up to 6 hours or, until the dough has doubled in size. If you want, leave it overnight the dough must be in a colder space allowing the bread to rise very slowly.
   </span>
   <br/>
   <span style="color: #929292; font-family: Arial; font-size: 10px;">
    Tip the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knock out the air from the bread. Lightly knead the dough for a few minutes then roll the dough into a ball, dust lightly with flour and place into either a floured banneton or a mixing bowl lined with a floured tea towel. Cover the bowl or banneton with plastic and place into a cool, not cold place as before and leave to rise slowly for 8 hours.
   </span>
   <br/>
   <span style="color: #929292; font-family: Arial; font-size: 10px;">
    Heat the oven to 220°C/ 475 °F /gas 6. Place an ovenproof bowl half filled with boiling water on the lowest shelf of the oven. The steam given off from the water helps to create a lovely crust to your loaf.
   </span>
   <br/>
   <span style="color: #929292; font-family: Arial; font-size: 10px;">
    Line a baking sheet with lightly oiled greaseproof paper. Tip the loaf from the banneton or bowl the risen loaf onto the sheet (do not worry if you loose a little air from the loaf as you do this, it will come back in the oven). Place the tray and loaf in the middle of the preheated oven and cook for 30 minutes, then lower the temperature to 200 °C/ 400 °F/gas 6 and cook for a further 20 minutes or until the loaf is golden brown, the outside crust crisp and the bread sounds hollow when tapped on the base.
   </span>
   <br/>
   <span style="color: #929292; font-family: Arial; font-size: 10px;">
    Place the loaf on a cooling rack, and leave to cool completely before eating. Rye sourdough can be used as any other bread and of course is delicious freshly made and spread with butter.

   <span style="color: #929292; font-family: Arial; font-size: 10px;">
    450gr strong white flour
   </span>
   <br/>
   <span style="color: #929292; font-family: Arial; font-size: 10px;">
    1 egg, beaten
   </span>
   <br/>
   <span style="color: #929292; font-family: Arial; font-size: 10px;">
    25gr unsalted butter, softened
   </span>
   <br/>
   <span style="color: #929292; font-family: Arial; font-size: 10px;">
    Pinch salt
   </span>
   <br/>
   <span style="color: #929292; font-family: Arial; font-size: 10px;">
    40gr sourdough starter/5gr of dried yeast (mixed up with the warm milk and 100gr of the flour into a ferment, or add straight to dough)
   </span>
   <br/>
   <span style="color: #929292; font-family: Arial; font-size: 10px;">
    300ml warm milk
   </span>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <span style="color: #929292; font-family: Arial; font-size: 10px;">
    Combine the first five ingredients thoroughly and knead for ten minutes until a good dough, fairly slack, this needs to be a soft, pudding type bread although definitely not a cake. Let rise for half an hour (or for a better, if less accurate, bake – around two hours) and bake in a greased tin for around 45 mins at 180C or until brown and crusty all over.
   </span>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12px;">
    Platt mentions using manchet, which uses more luxurious ingredients (egg, butter, milk - dairy)
   </span>
   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12px;">
    Because the manchet is only supposed to rise for half an hour (according to the recipe cited on the website above), we will make dough for rye bread first and let rise, and then later come back to the manchet toward the end of the four hours of rising, make manchet dough and let rise for half an hour
   </span>
   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12px;">
    Accuracy to historical recipes for bread may be superfluous; we don’t know what kind of bread is being referred to in recipes, or whether bread for casting includes all ingredients that bread for eating would; is salt necessary? If salt is just included for taste, would it have been baked into bread used for casting?
   </span>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12px;">
    Discussed questions having to do with procedures of baking, letting dough rise and molding; in particular, when bread comes out of oven, how do we mold pith, and into what shape? How soon after bread comes out of the oven do we need to mold objects? Do we bake again with objects inside of mold? Do we try to stretch mold, as manuscript p. 140v suggests? (“Mold it with the pith of
   </span>
   <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.5;">
    the bread just out of the oven, or like that aforementioned, &amp; and in drying out it will diminish &amp; by consequence so too the medal that you have cast. You can, in this way, in lengthening out or enlarging the imprinted bread, vary the figure &amp; from one face make several quite different ones.”)
   </span>
   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12px;">
    Will be interesting to compare sizes of cast objects with size of patterns - especially more round/three-dimensional objects. How large can the object be in different dimensions? Two of the objects we intend to cast (medallion &amp; bottle opener) are very flat, and third (Buddha figurine) is more round. Will the one with more depth cast well? Will wax or other casting material be able to work its way into the entire mold?

    1:05 - We let dough rise for six hours (~1pm-7pm), which is not full amount of time specified in recipe; we assume that this will result in thicker, denser bread; since we don’t have the full amount of time to let dough rise (recipe says 6 hours, then to knead, then another 8 hours, all in a cool place) we placed the dough in mixing bowl covered with saran wrap under a lamp with an incandescent bulb

   </h3>
   <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">
    On Monday Diana and I picked up some starters at Silver Moon Bakery, which the owner Judith Norell was generous enough to share. She gave us a bit of both their Rye starter, and their Rye/All purpose- flour starter. Before I could place them in my kitchen, however, they had to come to class with me. I am uncertain whether this fluctuation in temperature for a few hours or their (dis)interest in art history caused them to not work. Or not quite. Unlike Diana's parts of the exact same starters (which did not take the same detour and whose apartment is a more agreeable temperature from what I hear) mine do not seem to grow. Yet.
   </span>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">
    This morning was very disappointing - none of my starters seemed to have grown. Or hardly. Yesterday both the wheat and rye starter seemed to have become less active and less sticky. This morning it may have been a bit more sticky again, but little growth. I decided not to feed them and instead only give them a little stir (to prevent the forming of too much of a crust). I gave them a double cover (two cotton kitchen towels instead of one) and let them be for the day. And, finally, I just came home to a beautifully grown - almost doubled - wheat starter (not to mention a somewhat-sour-smelling apartment). That is the one we shall be using tomorrow. Although the rye starter may still play its role in our experiment as well. Now, I gave them their daily meal again, the usual amounts, and I keep my fingers crossed.
