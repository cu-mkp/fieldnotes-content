   <strong>
    Applying Wax to a Dental Impression
   </strong>

   <br/>
   Observations:
   <br/>
   -As in Bob's sandcasting video, note the (conscious) total lack of PPE - he is waiting for lunch and has just performed a fire drill but continues to work anyways without a labcoat, and consciously concerned about cutting himself by mishandling a razor blade (and yet continuing to do so...).
   <br/>
   -The loud sounds of the workshop are not a distraction for the experienced professional who is used to hearing them.
   <br/>
   -The tools he uses to manipulate the wax are heated - he starts using a regular tool that he heats in a flame (the "old-fashioned" way), then uses what is more conventional today, an electric wax tool. What is old-fashioned to the modern dental office had not even been invented yet when our manuscript's artisan was crafting.

    Freehand Wax Design (Gecko)

   <br/>
   Observations:
   <br/>
   -I did not mention the subject to my brother at all beforehand, and he referred to his process of casting a wax gecko he was designing as alchemy.
   <br/>
   -Interesting the use of the oil-based lubricant to be able to free the wax model from the plastic background it is being created on - reminds of many mentions in the manuscript of using various oils to free various items from molds, etc. Also, interesting that he has no idea what is in the lubricant. Today's makers have the luxury of being so much more divorced from their materials. Also as one of the "expert makers" in the dental office, note that he mentions he does not need to know what the lubricant is made out of, only how to request it when he is being assisted by someone.
   <br/>
   -Interesting discussion on his part of how the dental office preserves the gold dust/filings from the work that is done by hand after the casting. The reason I can't get a video of the casting process today in my family's office (the video I got is from an unrelated lab upstairs in the same building which they sometimes farm out extra work to) is in fact precisely because this machine is not working and so there would be no point to cast today.

    Casting Two Fillings in Gold
   </strong>
   <br/>

   </iframe>
   <br/>
   Observations:
   <br/>
   -Not mentioned in the video, but note that the three-pronged pieces of metal that are being melted to create these fillings are the cast-off bits cut away from previous impressions. Even in the modern dental workshop, the reuse of materials is important.
   <br/>
   -Interesting the collaboration between the two "maker labs" in the same building. This dental lab technician is happy to assist me because of his lab's sometime partnership with my family's practice. It's in both their interest to help each other out, although in certain situations they could be seen as competitors.
