    &lt;ab id=“p015r_b2”&gt;Candlesticks and small works are cast in a box mold with sand.Having stamped the work, sprinkle it with flour in order to make the copper or latten run better. When the sand has been in use for one month, it is necessary to take some new [sand] because that which has been used, being cooked again+, dries &amp; loses its bond. Yet it is used mixed with the new [sand], because it makes the work less porous. Large works such as artillery, bells and similar things are cast in earth, and copper cast in earth makes less crust and is whiter than when cast in sand. The earth is sandy clay mixed with horse dung and cloth waste. The earth that has been used for casting, which is black, baked and as if burnt, is mixed with artificial sand, and is very good. For softening and making the copper run, once it is melted, one throws in some lead, which does not form an alloy but is found on the surface of the cast.&lt;/ab&gt;

    &lt;ab id=”p068r_b3a”&gt;I have tried four kinds of
    <strong>
     sand
    </strong>
    for
    <strong>
     lead
    </strong>
    and
    <strong>
     tin
    </strong>
    :
    <strong>
     chalk
    </strong>
    , crushed
    <strong>
     glass
    </strong>
    ,
    <strong>
     tripoli
    </strong>
    and burnt
    <strong>
     linen
    </strong>
    , all four are excellent. As to the
    <strong>
     chalk
    </strong>
    , it needs to be of the softest kind available, like the
    <strong>
     <u>
      Champagne
     </u>
     chalk
    </strong>
    used by
    <em>
     painters
    </em>
    . It releases very cleanly, needs not be dampened with
    <strong>
     magistry
    </strong>
    or with anything else, but is used in its natural dry state and finely pulverized. The first cast is always cleaner, however it will sustain two or three castings. Should you only cast once, keep in mind, while remaking your box mold, to take powdered
    <strong>
     chalk
    </strong>
    that has not yet been used, since the one previously used in the box has dried out and will not bind and hold together as well as fresh
    <strong>
     chalk
    </strong>
    . Crushed
    <strong>
     glass
    </strong>
    can be made from ordinary
    <strong>
     glass sand
    </strong>
    , however
    <strong>
     cristallo glass
    </strong>
    is more excellent, because
    <strong>
     common glass
    </strong>
    contains
    <strong>
     saltwort
    </strong>
    only, while
    <strong>
     cristallo glass
    </strong>
    contains both
    <strong>
     salt of tartar
    </strong>
    and
    <strong>
     saltwort
    </strong>
    . Both of them help the fusion, during which the glass is calcinated and reduced to its prime matter. In order to calcinate it perfectly, throw your pieces of
    <strong>
     glass
    </strong>
    , of whichever sort, among the largest possible glowing
    <strong>
     coals
    </strong>
    , unless some other violent heat source is available. And once the glass is red hot, throw it into
    <strong>
     water
    </strong>
    .

    and soon you will crumble it between your fingers, then it is easily crushed in a metal mortar, or better in an iron mortar. Then it will be easy to grind it on the porphyry, and not on the common marble slab which would corrode it. You must grind it with water very smoothly, then put it on your nail it should be very soft without any ruggedness, like the colors ground by the painters for use with oil of […] When dry, use it for box mold, instead of sand, without wetting it or even reheating if you do not want to. Spread on the pipe smoke of sulphur, or some smoke from the top of the beeswax candle which does not make a lot of smoke. Your work in pure lead and tin will be clean, as tripoli stone sofly pulverized which is not softened. Burned cloth is easier to use than the other because it does not need to be reheated nor softened. It mold and can be removed very cleanly from the mold, as the above, and it should enable several fusions. First of all burn it on a flame, then let it burning over this heat, until […] Then grind it on the marble slab or between a sheet of paper. Reheat it in a reddened crucible in order to make a powder as fine as possible. I think it would be much better. When you burn cloth it makes very little powder, so if you want to spare your powder, only cover the medal you want to mold, and fill the box mold with crushed slate which also mold very clean. However note that the first cast is the most beautiful and the cleanest. Soft tin which seems to be burnished, which is sold by the .. mold very clean, and looks like silver color without mixing anything to it. It is true that you must cast very hot and the molded object must be 4 fingers far from the cast. In order to know it’s heat, first of all melt it very hot, then put inside the cast a piece of paper or a straw which should simmer, then take it off the fire, let it rest, and cast. Mix tin &lt;/ab&gt;

    <strong>
     sand
    </strong>
    ] that is in any way lean &amp; arid, such that it does not bind at all, like that from the sea or from sandy roads dried out by the sun. But choose preferably that from quarries or rock caves, since that one is best, as long as it is very fine. You will know the vein if, in the greyish rocks or quarries that seem to be made of sand, after rainy weather, you see certain little heaps like dust attached to the said rocks, or if the humidity causes them to shed stones that crumble easily between your hands. You will also find sand in lean soils, which comes off in large lumps like tuf stones, or in boulbène soils, which sands are much better than those from fat and strong soils. And do not take it from the surface, lest it be mixed with common soil, but three or 4 feet below and closest to the tuf or stone. When it comes off in large lumps it appears to have started to form itself into stone, but once wet it comes apart easily. When breaking it up, make sure that it is quite granular and that in crushing it between the fingers, it becomes really very fine, keeping nevertheless its sandy asperity, without muddying the fingers like clay.

    <strong>

    which is soft and heavy, wants to be cast much hotter than

    . When it is not hot enough, it makes lines in the medal.
    <strong>
     Straw
    </strong>
    burns in it, if it is hot [enough]. It makes a
    <strong>
     solder
    </strong>
    so soft and runny that it can be melted in a
    <strong>
     tin

    dish. It is composed of one part out of

    , and another part of

     lead
    </strong>
    . It [the
    <strong>
     solder
    </strong>
    ] runs very cleanly and casts in sheets, but the work is very rough and breaks. The best
    <strong>
     solder,
    </strong>
    for casting well, is the common one, but it leaves certain rough crumbs. Combine
    <strong>
     lead
    </strong>
    with
    <strong>
     tin
    </strong>
    so that the
    <strong>
     ingot
    </strong>
    that you are going to cast becomes smooth and lustrous and polished, and doesn’t make any “eyes” or bubbles except for a small point in the middle. And this sign will tell you that there is enough
    <strong>
     tin
    </strong>
    , otherwise the
    <strong>
     lead
    </strong>
    dominates too much. The

    . The good [
    <strong>
     sand
    </strong>
    ] is well dried and fine and thin, however make it as fine as possible. The
    <strong>
     sand
    </strong>
    wants to be recooked rather than put to work [directly]. And to mold with it, it wants to be well dampened and then recooked, not all at once nor under a lot of pressure, because this spoils it, and makes it shrink and also makes it crumble. But if you reheat it, and take your time, it will make it very firm, to be good for molding. It is necessary to filter it through a
    <strong>
     shirt sleeve
    </strong>
    in order to make it the more fine, with the aim of putting it first on the piece to be cast.&lt;/ab&gt;

    of the frame, because it would turn it sour, and make it filled with bubbles. Always cast higher than the mold. Pay attention that the cast is not too wide or too deep because the narrowest is the best one. Because when it is large, the weight of the matter which runs breaks and spreads the mold and fills the matter with bubbles. When you have casted, gently hit your frame, so that the matter spreads better.

     bellows
    </strong>
    are placed in the medium, thus it heats better than on the grate. It is true that the crucible can easily break but you can lute it as

    do. It is necessary that you keep the
    <strong>
     coals
    </strong>
    [lit], which are between the bellows and the crucible. Cast all at once and not gradually otherwise the conduit will be stopped by the matter. It is better make a tube which could pour the cast into the medal. It is necessary that you stir the melted matter with a stick, so that the matter heats well at the bottom.

I oiled my medal because oil cleans it without damaging it.

And before that, I had so reheated my molded box frame, now on the flame of my stove, now putting glowing coals beneath it, that it became almost red. I let it cool and cast it. It came out with a quite neat relief on one side &amp; hollow on the other, as much the figure as the letters. It is true that the material was whitish, as though it were metallic, but this was because of the potin. I made another cast with frying pan material, alone in the same sand, but not as reheated.

    &lt;ab id=”p085v_b4c”&gt;Then I molded burned bull’s foot bone, pulverized &amp; strained through a double sieve, and wet with egg white or wine boiled with the root of an elm. I lightly knocked on top of it while molding. While opening the box frame, I found that the figures had come out not at all clean &amp; it left the molds as though they were floury &amp; crumbling. I wet the bone sand more so that it held together well between the figures, and in this way I molded neatly with good come-away. And even though it seemed like the ground bone was lumpy, when casting with frying pan material, it turned out that my figures were quite clean. It is true that I had really really heated up my box frame, it did not admit but one cast. I find that, when a sand is so fine that it gets as heavy as ceruse &amp; even, without finding it arid, thin, sandy &amp; rather spongy, that [sic] it molds quite neatly but it does not receive metal very well, as if it were porous and sucking up the material. But, being fatty &amp; even, it puffs up &amp; does not receive subtle impressions at all. I believe that the secret of casting well lies in finding a sand that conforms well to the metal, this one for lead, the other for another, because each has its own particular one, so that it be molded easily and keenly. Then let it firm up on its own for a few days if you have the leisure for it. And afterwards let it really heat up again, not instantly nor with a large fire, but little by little, otherwise it will crumble &amp; always have some defects. Finally you must cast copper or latten or other great metals very hot and if possible with a large quantity of material that has a lot more heat than a small quantity. It’s necessary that the box frame be cold &amp; that you cast all in one go. Always lute the opening of your box frame because metal touching fire or metal. &lt;/ab&gt;

Also make sure that the mold &amp; the cast are indeed reheated. Also cast in one go &amp; outside of the wind. And if your medal is really thin, when you want to mold it, put a card, or two or three thicknesses of paper, so that the mold will be lower than the cast. Also cast in the place where your medal is least thick &amp; where the relief is lowest.&lt;/ab&gt;

For tin, I believe that you cannot find a material that takes to powder better, and even for use withfine lead which has almost better results than tin. The bone of an ox hoof is always dry, that is why you must mix it with fatty sand, so it will bind like tripoli, salts, felt, ashes and similar materials.

It should be humidified in a cellar or in the cool humid evening air, or to have it quickly, in a sheet of paper in a moist towel. Take care not to leave it too long because it will soften, which would not be good if you wanted to use it as a box mold. However you can use it well as a core provided that you dry it gently and away from the fire. Otherwise the heat would make it swell, and push the salt onto the surface, causing lumps. If you want to mold a core, rub your medal with aspic oil. It is better to use 4 ounces of ammonia salt per pound. Humidify it in a damp place for two or three days, so that the material can be handled without sticking. You will mold very cleanly. Let the mold dry out and reheat it, that way it will get body, and become as hard as stone and when it is like that it is far easier to remove from the mold. If you do not reheat it, it could crumble when removed from the mold because of its thinness. It is the same with a large relief medal. Once you have molded, pulverize the material like before, and moisten it in a damp atmosphere.&lt;/ab&gt;

Easy to grind, this sand looks like calcined alabaster, and provides a very clean mold. I have not found another as suitable for delicate bas reliefs. It is also excellent to mold as a core, without any box mold. You must grind it very finely on a porphyry with gummed water or pure water, then apply a thick coat (as thick as mustard or a little bit thicker) over the medal, which has already been lightly rubbed with oil, walnut oil or, even better, aspic oil. For best results, let it dry by itself, away from fire, for one or two days. If you are in a hurry, you can heat it; it should not break if the coat is quite thick. If it is suddenly exposed to fire, some holes will appear; that does not happen if it has been gently dried. Once dry, reheat it, and it should allow for several castings.&lt;/ab&gt;

    &lt;ab id=”p118v_b2a”&gt;The same sand which has been used in composed heated cores, i.e. of plaster, brick and feather alum, is excellent for casting in box molds, and I have tried it as follows. I crushed the pieces which had come out of core molds in a mortar, pestling slowly, because this sand is very soft. I did not pass it through a sieve, because the feather alum mixed in, which makes it bind together, would not pass through. But I did refine upon marble what seemed to me too coarse, and having thus prepared it, I moistened it with the sal ammoniac water made of sal ammoniac the size of two walnuts, in a bottle of common water the size of a bottle in which one boils ground barley, or in a good pot of water. You should find the water fairly salty. I mixed in half a glass of sal ammoniac two silver spoonfuls of spirits. Having thus moistened the sand in order to give it a nice hold, though it still came apart easily, I sprinkled my medal with charcoal pulverized with a file to remove the oil fat, and all other fat. One must avoid these, since they hinder good stripping. I blew on the medal and molded it, and with the female part of the box mold full, I marked and made a line on the back and side of the medal, and on the nearby sand as well. In order that the second box mold take the imprint thereupon to indicate the place for making the cast, I uncovered the contour of the medal and pounced the whole side with pulverized carbon, and then I filled the male part with sand. I separated the box mold and did not strike the corners of the medal to make it strip, since that cracks the sand and makes it come apart. But I did strike the back of the box mold, holding the place of the medal on the bottom, and it molded very cleanly. If it hadn’t stripped thus, I would have waited to remove it until the box molds had been dried out over heat. I lit a row of charcoal between two little trivets of iron in the form that you see [viz. image id=”p118_d2” in the left margin], and put the back of the box molds thereupon, and the imprint on top, since in this way, they dry out slowly. And if, by chance, they should crack from being too moistened, it’s on the back that they take the harshest heat, and the imprint remains safe and whole.

    Candlesticks and small works are cast in a box mold with sand. Having stamped the work, sprinkle it with flour in order to make the copper or latten run better. When the sand has been in use for one month, it is necessary to take some new [sand] because that which has been used, being cooked again*, dries &amp; loses its bond. Yet it is used mixed with the new [sand], because it makes the work less porous. Large works such as artillery, bells and similar things are cast in earth, and copper cast in earth makes less crust and is whiter than when cast in sand. The earth is sandy clay mixed with horse dung and cloth waste. The earth that has been used for casting, which is black, baked and as if burnt, is mixed with artificial sand, and is very good. For softening and making the copper run, once it is melted, one throws in some lead, which does not form an alloy but is found on the surface of the cast.

    The sand must be made from very dry and arid material, and well- annealed because if it were humid, like founder’s sand, the gold and silver would rub off and bear damage. It is also necessary for the earth to absorb the metal because cast gold or silver become very porous. That is why it must be beaten out again, otherwise it is brittle, as seen in spoon handles.

    To make it flow neatly, take half metal and half copper. Others take a measure of potin and a measure of latten. Others take a measure of latten from candlesticks and a measure of latten from a basin. And among basins, the latten from larger ones is harder than that from skillets because the material must be softer in order to give them such a small circumference. For the large ones [basins], whose circumference is more ample, one may take a harder material. The harder the latten, the better it flows and the neater it casts, but it must be cast very hot. As one wishes to cast, one should put lead on the material, which makes it flow, run and smoke, but be careful that the mold does not get damaged. And if you want to cast pieces on fire, mix more rosette than latten, so that it is less brittle. The founder’s mould used to melt metal should be better that those used by glassmakers because glass is not as heavy as metal. And in this instance, one should coat the founder’s mold with earth and crushed glass.

    They crack if they are often melted again and thicken and burn, so that even if a salmon is made, the tin becomes thick at the bottom if it is not stirred often during casting. It is better for casting to melt some lead and some tin and to renew it each time. The antimony makes them breakable, the iced tin makes them whiter. Pewterers mix a pound of iced tin with a quintal of fine tin and two and a half or three pounds of red, mild cauldron copper, which is better than latten. There is fine and mild tin and sour tin. Pewterers cast the sour as grills to sell it better. They go better and more cleanly in stone moulds than in copper molds because copper is fat and draws the mild tin when heated. Or when casting a large work, three quarts of lead with one pound of mild tin produces a very liquid mixture which is appropriate for casting and is as shiny as a mirror. Laxunge glass lightens them. All things that lighten metals a lot and remove their thickness and natural density and make them as liquid as water make them appropriate for casting because their thickness stops them from flowing. The mild tin is more even than the sour tin, which is whiter and seems to have been polished like a mirror. To properly alloy the tin and the lead, you have to melt them together, Then, mix them together a little bit at a time and throw it often on a marble tile. And when it is going well, you will see it becoming unified and shining as if it were burnished. Because sometimes it becomes spotted due to too much lead and sometimes due to too

    Those who cast these small items, sold in front of the churches, melt half a pound of lead on a pound of tin, and cast in a stone frame. And if they want their work [to be] whiter, they use half of tin and half of lead, but the first mixture is the best, and does not make bubbles.You have to cast it hot enough, otherwise it won’t flow. Some [people] smoke their molds with a rosin candle for neat casting. The antimony makes the matter harsh and breakable. The looking-glass tin makes the work whiter, but does not make it flow more than with tin that is correctly made with pure lead. Those who make very precise lead castings use puncheons. Tintiers cast with copper molds. It is said that one makes lead adhere to glass by using resin. Some people put a quarter of tin on lead. Glass tin makes the work stronger.

   <br/>
   &lt;ab id=“p139v_b1a”&gt;Take some
   <strong>
    white wax
   </strong>
   which is much more appropriate for this kind of work than anything else, because it is much firmer and does not leave as much filth, as much as you need to cast the animal that you propose, and no more. And [take] a half quantity of
   <strong>
    ground coal
   </strong>
   and neatly sieved through a cloth or coal sleeve, using it to give some color to your
   <strong>
    wax
   </strong>
   , that would otherwise be transparent and you will not be able to see your lines as clearly. Put your
   <strong>
    wax
   </strong>
   on the coal fire to melt. And when it is well-melted and well-liquified, take a full eared-porringer of melted wax, [and] as much
   <strong>
    sulphur
   </strong>
   as the amount of a large pulverized walnut. Melt all of over a slow fire and when it is melted, do not leave it on the fire because it will become too hot. But take it off and keep stirring it with a little stick and when it has finished bubbling and is as liquified as water, cast it into the
   <strong>
    wax
   </strong>
   that you will have previously removed from the fire. And mix and stir both of the them so that they join together. After stir in little by little while continuously mixing, the
   <strong>
    charcoal
   </strong>
   that has been repeatedly ground, and in this way it will be very well incorporated. This is how you will know that your
   <strong>
    wax
   </strong>
   has gone beyond its ideal heating point, it will release no more smoke, it will start to have lines appearing on the side and not in the middle, and those lines will be close to each other. If you cast too hot, you will not be able to separate your wax from your mold and it would stick to the cast. When it is at the right state, stir it with a little stick so that the pulverized
   <strong>
    charcoal
   </strong>
   is well mixed in and has not fallen to the bottom of the mixture. And in this way, throw it in your mold bit by bit and not in one go, because
   <strong>
    wax
   </strong>
   is not runny.&lt;/ab&gt;
   <br/>
   &lt;note id=“p139v_c1a”&gt;This black sulphured
   <strong>
    wax
   </strong>
   is for fashioning round figures that do not come out of the mold. And they need to be burned in the moule au noyau rather than be opened like the ones that have something jutting out or an intertwining of legs and arms. And this
   <strong>
    wax
   </strong>
   , thanks to the
   <strong>
    sulphur,
   </strong>
   will melt with little heat and leave without leaving any filth. If by some misfortune the crushed
   <strong>
    charcoal
   </strong>
   remains in ashes, when you open the mold and blow on it, it will come clean.&lt;/note&gt;

    A very thick mould wouldn’t break as easily while reheating, as a thin mould which shouldn’t be on fire for a long time, fire would damage thin moulds, even if made from some plaster not very very strong
   </span>
   <br/>
   <span style="color: #333333;">
    It is much better to reheat one single mould than to reheat several moulds together, because several moulds need a higher fire, than one single mould, also the side of the moulds which touch lighted coals reflect the heat, thus moulds break and crack most of the time.
   </span>
   <br/>
   <span style="color: #333333;">
    So, heat your mould one by one, and do not light any fire, just cover the mould

   <span style="color: #333333;">
    Most of the time tin and lead turn brittle when they become red-hot , to soften the matter do not cast it red, and the cast must be pointed

    You must thread this point in the middle of the cast, through the hole. Use this process with moulds which are stripped in several parts, like moulds for turtles. That way the core won’t move, when you have a mould in two parts you don’t need to thread any points through the hole in the middle of the mould
   </span>
   <br/>
   <span style="color: #333333;">
    Make some notches all around the hole where you want to cast before moulding the core this is a way to fix the mould. Thanks to the tallow the wax wouldn’t block the hole while emptying, make a 50/50 mixture of tallow and black wax.
   </span>
   <br/>
   <span style="color: #333333;">
    It is much better to mould hollow all kind of thick pieces, because a mass of lead remain hot for a long time and eat the mould
   </span>
   <br/>
   <span style="color: #333333;">
    After the cast, mould the belly side of the shell, where you did the hole, and solder it.
   </span>
   <br/>
   <span style="color: #333333;">
    When your core is casted, it is much better to dip your mould into hot water to open it in order to remove as much as possible wax. Do always soften your mould into hot water. The less wax you get the best it is, because when you heat your mould again you won’t get so many lumps. Also if your mould contain less wax it will heat quicker. When you open the mould […] but you can rework it easily, do not cast that .

   <span style="color: #333333;">
    Moulding hollow
   </span>
   <br/>
   <span style="color: #333333;">
    Thread a wire through the hole in order to hold the core and to prevent it from moving. Put your mould on the table, the hole side up, as you see, then set your circle of clay which must be two fingers high around the hole, as you did with the other moulds. Then dilute your sand which must not be too thick, and pour it through the hole of the circle, the hole must be full. But do not pour your sand into the middle of the hole, but on the side because the already made mould absorb and […] the liquid. The new sand you cast on the side of the mould dries very quickly, and would block the mould which couldn’t be entirely filled up, when you are casting on the side, if you see that your mould is blocked put your finger or any point through the hole in order to unblock it, that way the hollow wax will be filled up, pour the thickest sand at the end in order to harden the mould because water always soften it. When your cast is made, cut the circle of clay and […] what is on the hole where you have moulded the core, this process won’t be seen. When your mould is arranged, lute it all around with the sand you had used to make the moulds, reheat your mould on a low fire at the beginning, put the hole side of your mould down that way the wax gently flow out. If you place your mould on a high fire until the wax has completely flowed out, wax would boil inside the mould and leave some lumps.

    The white wax from which you had made your sulphured black wax hasn’t so much matter when dry and cleaned, and doesn’t leave any lump in your mould, also it flow very gently out of the mould. Coal which is mixed with the white wax could leave some matters in the mould, but they can be burned and reduced to ashes which can be empty by blowing. You can open your mould when the wax is melted if there aren’t any delicate thing which could break in your mould. Open the clamps made of lute, then open your mould and cover it with a coat of common lute, then dust the whole thing with crushed bricks in order to better handle the mould. let dry the lute softly instead of drying it on fire which would melt the wax. When the wax has flowed out of the mould, burn the wax and the coat which remain in the mould. when your mould had been heated once, lute again because bad plaster make the mould shrink, the joints would open and make burrs. Do not heat your mould twice if you cast only lead or tin, but the lute must be very dry and the mould not very hot. If you want to mould something thick, like turtles, or something hollow mix half lead with half tin, but if you want to mould something thin like flowers mix more lead than tin which swell when casted a bit thick, and which oftenly make flaws. Mister Alexandre says that he never had any problem with a 50/50 mixture of lead and tin to mould think as thick as a back’s knife. If you add some filings the joints will be almost invisible, and the burrs will be very small and fine. You can rework your mould, dip it into water for a long time, then pull the earth of the core out of the hole, but before removing it, rework the turtle, this earth can be used as cement to rework or flatten something with a small carving tool. If there are some burrs on the joints of the mould, remove them with a burin called […], a small sharp knife, or a small file, then use the small carving tool. Keep the real turtle in front of you in order to make a realistic work.
   </span>
   <br/>
   <span style="color: #333333;">
    You can […] (this work is missing, lets say fix, maybe it is harden) on a file the point of a small carving tool which isn’t hammered in order to make something lumpy. Make a 50/50 mixture of lead and fine tin to mould these turtles and hollow things. It is much more difficult and much longer to make a mould for turtle than to make a dozen of moulds for flowers. If you add filings to your mixture you won’t get any burrs, but if there are some burrs on the sides of the mould, they’ll be much thinner than a piece of paper if the mould had been squeezed with a press. To make scales of turtles and of other animals use some small carving tools which are round like the tool used by a shoe-reworker (porte-pièce : is the tool used by the shoe-reworker to set a piece on the shoe, I didn’t find the translation)
   </span>
   <br/>
   <span style="color: #333333;">
    Turtles which are not mouled hollow doesn’t need so much work. You can mould them in two pieces, rework them with small carving tool, (and other kind of carving tools) &lt;/ab&gt;

    Cast cold black wax in the mould. It is necessary to open half of your mould to cast, if the figure made of black wax breaks, it is not a problem because you can rework it with the point of a warm wire. You could also join the pieces in the mould by joining very well the two half parts of the mould. when the figure is large, cross inside the mould wires in order to hold the core &lt;/ab&gt;
   </span>
   <br/>
   &lt;ab id=”p151r_b3”&gt;
   <br/>
   <span style="color: #333333;">
    When you cast lead or tin, you must redden your mould as a mould where you burn animals. That way wax melts well and don’t leave anything inside the mould, because wax flow out if you bend the mould to the cast while heating. When the mould is heated, let it cool down, then blow inside the mould and suck up, that way the ashes in the wax comes out of the mould, do use bellows &lt;/ab&gt;

   </strong>
   <strong>
    water
   </strong>
   [and leave it] for two hours, and once your
   <strong>
    water
   </strong>
   is cold, throw it out and turn the phial upside down onto its opening on a perfectly even table and in a room where there is not a bit of draft or wind. Then prepare a stopper of fresh
   <strong>
    wax
   </strong>
   , wrapped in
   <strong>
    oilcloth
   </strong>
   , and adapt it precisely to the
   <strong>
    glass
   </strong>
   phial so that it will be ready to stop it once you have put in the fruit. And once you have hand-picked the fruit, only the non-rotten fruit, and on a warm and dry day, withdraw to the room, well closed so that no wind or draft can get in, and put it gently and deftly in the bottle. Then stop the bottle well with the stopper and lute it, making your lute, if you want, with some
   <strong>
    quicklime
   </strong>
   and
   <strong>
    oil
   </strong>

    Clean very carefully the platter and the spoon you had used to soak sand after casting otherwise they would keep some dry sand which would crumble into your sand when you cast again, and that could damage your work.

    Wax alone cool down very soon, and does not run everywhere very well, tallow keeps its heat and run everywhere. But tallow alone is not good that is why you have to mix wax and tallow together.

    You haven’t to make a paste to cast, because if your mixture is thinner it will perfectly cover your medal. Make a paste to cast fine works. The thinner mixture allow your flat medal to be easily stripped. Your cast must not be as thick as your medal, in the case this medal isn’t as thin as a sheet of paper. First cast where your medal is, do not make a thick cast into the intake of your medal or work, otherwise your work wouldn’t be well stripped. Make a cast not very thick from the middle of your work to the top, and make a cast very thin from the middle of your work to the bottom. Do not forget to notch the top of your mold, that way metal won’t run too fast. &lt;/ab&gt;

You can carry an ant-hill with its dirt in a barred full of earth, and keep them there and they will lay their eggs and in this way, you can always have access to them when you need them, should you enjoy feeding nightingales. When you caught it, it was fat and full. And to keep it in such good shape, on the first day, you must take it in you hand and open its beak and place in it, using a sharp twig, some mutton heart or other delicate flesh, chopped up not too finely, so that the belly does something, and make sure that it does not get smaller or thinner, until it has gotten used to it. And feed it in this way three or four times a day, and also give it something to drink. The next morning, you will give him in his cage some well-minced flesh mixed with the yolk of a hard-boiled egg, and change this mixture two or three times a day, because it will not eat it if it is hard and not fresh. And If it goes half a day without eating, you must feed it as before and do so until&lt;/ab&gt;

    not like other things. And for this one, you can cast two or three times until your mold is full. Now, concerning this mold of pulverized white
    <strong>
     plaster
    </strong>
    &amp; reheated in the manner of the
    <strong>
     sand
    </strong>
    from the preceding recipes, you should have made it long ago because it is used many times. But, before using it, soak it for a good hour in
    <strong>
     cold water
    </strong>
    , &amp; at a minimum, at least as long in
    <strong>
     hot water
    </strong>
    that at first is so hot that you can’t hold your finger in it. And not that it absorbs no more, but that it appears very wet overall without water seeping into it. In removing it closed from the
    <strong>
     hot water
    </strong>
    , cast your
    <strong>
     wax
    </strong>
    in such a state of heat as has been described. And neither the first nor the second casting will readily come out well, hardly, until the mold is soaked. Let it cool down before opening it so that the cast thing not break. You will know that the casting is good when the
    <strong>
     wax
    </strong>
    coming back out of the mold is thin and even. Remember to make several castings along the whole length of the mold so that in this way the
    <strong>
     wax
    </strong>
    runs better.&lt;/ab&gt;

   <span style="color: #333333;">
    Make the first casting twice as large as other molds. And if, in the first casting, your work fills with bubbles and in so doing does not come out neatly, it’s all the same, because you have to face the fact that the three or four first do not readily come out well. Firstly, you will know whether there are a few barbs that keep it from stripping well. And you will remove them if, on their own, they do not remove themselves in the two or three first castings. And the more that you cast, the more you will do it neatly. And your mold will serve you more than one hundred times if it Is well governed. But it is good to soak it one night or one day before casting so that it be well soaked. The same must be done for fruits made from sugar. This
    <strong>
     wax
    </strong>
    is very soft &amp; friendly &amp; pliant, like copper. And if it is hard [this is] because of
    <strong>
     sulfur
    </strong>
    , which makes it melt more easily than than other [wax], so much that you can see evidence on a hot slate. And the
    <strong>
     sulfur
    </strong>
    that you put inside will be found the second time that you melt it, [as] cracks on the bottom. Having in this way passed through
    <strong>
     wax
    </strong>
    , it will not catch fire at all when put to a candle. And in this case, I believe that it will cast quite the medal [illegible]. One uses the same
    <strong>
     wax
    </strong>
    in place of
    <strong>
     varnish
    </strong>
    to [illegible].&lt;/ab&gt;

    When your animal is cast, cut away the broth &amp; superfluous things with a hot pen knife. And if you want, plait and wrap it around some stick or candle, put it in some
    <strong>
     hot water
    </strong>
    to soften and hold it in turning it around.&lt;/note&gt;

    Lower the protrusions of the castings so that they be even &amp; that the

   How to reduce a round form into a hollow one
   <br/>
   You have firstly to mould it with some plaster as aforesaid and cast some wax into the plaster with which you will get your relief that you will prepare very neat and will create it as you want. Then you will mould this wax reief again in some plaster or even better with some soaked sand like for a […] and cast into it some lead and you will get a very neat relief and i not ; mend it on some cement or other and make sure it is always well […] and you will use this one as a Template to make as many hollow ones as you want. In that way, put the half of your lead figure oiled and moistened with some brandy as aforesaid on your clay plaque, then mould this half with a white plaster. After being entangled and well making the plaster even, take your sulphur mixed black wax as aforesaid because it does not leave anything in the mold and melts quickly. Dip it into some hot urine and after being soften, press as a print on the half of the lead figure and it will be neatly hollowed. Adjust then the hollow wax in a square as you want, make sure it is thick enough and well even on each side and then mould this hollow wax and print on one side and flat and even on the other in the same way as you mould flat medals in wax or metal ones as core. And the core mould will give you in silver or other metal you wish a figure similar to the wax, that is to say flat and even on one side and hollow on the other. And after cleaning this hollow and withen it if it is made of metal, you can mix some sugar (Moulds)
   <br/>
   Margin : after making a clay paste and pressing the half of the waxed figure slightly oiled to more easily take it off
   <br/>
   The transparent wax is not good on the contrary to the thick one to make a good print
   <br/>
   You can mould the other one as you have moulded it with plaster and wax

    If you want to cast some flat medal or some animal that is not very heavy, and that must not be burnt inside the mold, you can rather cast in plaster &amp; brique mixed as above; and not in plaster alone, because it will shrink too much feeling a vehement fire if it is not kept from it. But, with the brick, it holds well. In any case, take heed to dry out your mold at length &amp; on a soft fire &amp; with patience, because it has no need of reheating. But when your work is of flowers or other things whose molds need to be reheated &amp; fired, mix the plaster with some stone alum &amp; also with filings. I have molded in plaster &amp; brick very neatly &amp; it has endured many castings.&lt;/ab&gt;

    I tried the plaster &amp; brick alone and molded en noyau with them as with the others. My mold was very clean, having lightly oiled my metal &amp; rubbed it with spirits. I made my casting wide at the entrance, proceeding while making it thin just until the medal is quite slender. I changed the casting which had taken a good hold of the medal. I dried out the mold on a soft fire &amp; at the end, let it really heat up without its turning red. I let it cool to such a degree that I could hold my finger to it without burning myself. I made a line of 4

    When there is nothing to burn inside your mold, it is not necessary to reheat for lead and tin. But for flowers and that which must be burned yes indeed.&lt;/note&gt;
