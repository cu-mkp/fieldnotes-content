intro: >
  Fall 2014 was the very first offering of the Laboratory Seminar <i>HIST GR8906: Craft and Science: Objects and Their Making in the Early Modern World</i> at Columbia University by the Making and Knowing Project. The course contributed to the collective production of <i><a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/">Secrets of Craft and Nature in Renaissance France. A Digital Critical Edition and English Translation of BnF Ms. Fr. 640</a></i>. The yearly theme was Moldmaking and Metalworking, and students in the course explored processes related to this theme and conducted hands-on reconstructions of related entries in BnF Ms. Fr. 640. The results of their skill building work from the beginning of the semester are recorded in Fieldnotes. As students worked towards composing critical commentary for <i>Secrets of Craft and Nature</i> in the form of <a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/essays">Research Essays</a>, they kept "Annotation" fieldnotes to document their research process, reconstructions, and hands-on work in the laboratory. Profiles were a way for students to introduce themselves to each other and the instructors. Other select course materials, such as collective notes and reference documents, are found in the Reference pages.
