Just a few remarks and questions:<br \/>\n- for clarity and comprehensivenss you couldalso add the French text on top of your fieldnotes, especially as the translation omits several important points as you found out and discussed last week, Eg. Also that you first calcine, then pulverize &amp; (!) then sieve. <br \/>\n- please note also the folio Numbers of other recipes you mention (eg on salalmoniac ratio)<br \/>\nLookings forward to the next trial with fireproof box molds, <br \/>\nJenny","replies":[]}
