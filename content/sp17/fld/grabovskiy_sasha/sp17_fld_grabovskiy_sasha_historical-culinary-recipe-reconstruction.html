   <u>
    <strong>
     A syrup of Vinegar good for to cool in any hot fever, or any other hot Sickness and to break Choler and gross Phlegm in the stomach.
    </strong>
   </u>
   <br/>
   Take one Fennel root of one year’s growth and 4 Parsley roots of a good size. If they are small take enough to equal the quantity of Fennel root. Take the same amount of Chicory roots and 2 big Dock roots (the yellowest are the best). Take the
   <em>
    pithes
   </em>
   out of them all and boil them in a in a gallon of water. Add a handful of Violet leaves and the same amount of young Mallow, and the same amount [i. of Endive. Let all this boil until
   <em>
    3 parts
   </em>
   of the water are consumed. Then strain it into a clean vessel and let it settle. Then take the clearest of the water and to every 2 pints of this water add one pint of the best Wine Vinegar you can find and one-and-a-half pints of Honey. Then boil and skim the top layer
   <em>
    until it becomes a syrup
   </em>
   . Put it into a glass and use as you like. When you intend to take it, put as much syrup as you want and add the same amount of clean water to make it thin enough to drink. If you don’t like honey, for every pint thereof add a pound of sugar.

    Take the pithes out:
   </strong>
   The central column of tissue in the trunk or branches of a tree, or in the stalk or stem of a plant; pith; the spongy inner tissue of other parts of a plant; also fig.; (b) the flesh of a fruit, pulp; (c) interior tissue (of a part of the body); also, the inner portion of various objects or substances

   A not entirely clear metric.

    Post-transcription, we visited the local Whole Foods, we realized that we were woefully unprepared to address the requirements of the recipe. After performing some detailed research we discovered that the materials could be acquired at a farmers market and at the herbs and roots store Flower Power.

    Subject: Execution
   </strong>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   We followed the recipe as outlined above.During the preparations, we had to make practical decisions that were not entirely spelled out in the recipe. For one, we decided to place the dried roots and leaves into cool water to soak for 15 minutes before turning on the heat and bringing the mixture to a boil. Additionally, we refrained from stirring the plant material to prevent excess bitterness. We also used a small flame to slowly bring the water and plants to a boil. We added the Violet leaves, mallow, and endive after the water and the first batch of materials was boiling. After boiling the initial quantity of material + water down to 75%, we had 1/2 pint of concentrated herbal water. We added approximately 1/4 pint each (1/2 pint total) of honey and vinegar to make a pint total of liquid in the pot. Then we boiled that mixture down by 50% (back to a 1/2 pint): this we interpreted to mean "Until it becomes a syrup." and hoped that it would thicken as it cooled. It did not thicken and, even at slightly below room temperature, the liquid is only slightly more viscous than water. The end product also tastes strongly of vinegar because the instructions demanded slightly less vinegar than honey, but we put in equal amounts due to human overzealousness.

    </li>
    <li>
     note (changing) conditions in the room
    </li>
    <li>
     note temperature of ingredients to be processed (e.g. cold from fridge, room temperature etc.)
    </li>
    <li>
     document materials, equipment, and processes in writing and with photographs
    </li>
    <li>
     notes on ingredients and equipment (where did you get them? issues of authenticity)
    </li>
    <li>
     note precisely the scales and temperatures you used (please indicate how you interpreted imprecise recipe instruction)
    </li>
