   The first step of this reconstruction was baking the bread for the molding procedures described in the manuscript. Although the author-practitioner does not specify the recipe for the bread, a contemporaneous recipe from John Evelyn (1620-1706), an English writer, provides us with an account of "The Several Manners of making Bread in France: Where by universal consent the best bread in the world is eaten." From his records, I followed the below excerpts:
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <u>
    {Excerpt re: Water}
   </u>
   <br/>
   <u>
    Water
    <em>

    </em>

   <br/>
   {Excerpt re: Knowing when the dough has risen}
   <br/>
   <u>
    <em>
     The mass well-kneaded, you shall turne it in the Trough, lainy the bottom upmost; then thrust {your?} fist in the middle of the dow to the very bottom of the trough in 2 or 3 paces then cover it well with meale-sack, clean blankets. Having let it stand thus awhile (longer in Winter than Summer) you find those holes clos’d or swell’d up; the rising is pefect.

    <u>
     QUESTIONS:
    </u>
   </strong>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “The 6th part” seems to refer to the total quantity of flour. Thus, if the total quantity of flour used would be 300 grams, I would add 50 grams of Levin (or sourdough starter) into 50 grams of flour as a first step.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “At first” seems to refer to the amount of flour taken to add Levin to. So the same as in the “6th part”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Although we do not know how much time to wait between the addition of the Levin to the flour, when the holes close up will be the cue, as seen in the excerpt.

    Subject: Post-fridge feeding
   </strong>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Because John Evelyn's instructions were not 100% exhaustive, and because refrigerator's were not available in his time, I followed the instructions on a contemporary website for what to do after removing the starter from the refrigerator. The starter had already been fed once, 7 days ago according to the instructions on the website, which called for an equal amount of starter, flour, and water to be mixed together.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   According to the contemporary instructions, the starter had to be fed twice at 12 hour intervals in order to be optimally "active".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At 8:45 pm, I removed the MASTER Starter (once-fed) from the refrigerator and allowed it to stand in a well-heated room.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At 9:22 pm, I opened the jar that contained the starter, The starter was smooth flowing, bubbly, and aerated. It smelled of buttermilk.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   I weighed, in a glass beaker, on a small kitchen scale:
   <br/>
   130 grams of Whole Wheat Stone Ground Organic Flour;
   <br/>
   130 grams of NYC Tap Water (Ionized);
   <br/>
   130 grams of MASTER Starter (once-fed) provided by Pamela H Smith.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   and mixed them together.

    Subject: Batch 1 Baking Procedures
   </strong>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At 03:40 am, I began the process for baking Batch 1, before the Starter would have been fully "activated" after refrigerator hibernation, according to contemporary websites.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   BATCH 1.
   <br/>
   STEP 1.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <u>
    <em>
     Take the 6th part of the quantity you intend to make, and put Levin into it; making a hole in the dow as you were directed.
    </em>
   </u>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   I weighed, in a glass beaker, on a small kitchen scale:
   <br/>
   <br/>
   50 grams of Whole Wheat Stone Ground Organic Flour;
   <br/>
   50 grams of MASTER Starter (once-fed) provided by Pamela H Smith.
   <br/>
   No water as Evelyn's notes did not call for it.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After kneading the pitiful mass, it was dry and crumbling. I made a small hole to the bottom of it with my finger.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/128418753@N06/32169305423/in/album-72157678295035352/" rel="nofollow" title="20170206_Grabovskiy_BreadMolding_003">

   At 09:00 am, the mass had not risen, the pathetic lump looked untouched from the previous night; the holes had not closed and, if possible, appeared to have gotten more pronounced.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/128418753@N06/32829421492/in/album-72157678295035352/" rel="nofollow" title="20170206_Grabovskiy_BreadMolding_004">

   BATCH 1.
   <br/>
   STEP 2.

   <br/>

    </em>
   </u>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   To the mixture in STEP 1, I added (weighed, in a glass beaker, on a small kitchen scale):
   <br/>
   <br/>
   50 grams of Whole Wheat Stone Ground Organic Flour;
   <br/>
   ~53 grams of warm NYC Tap water (Ionized), though Evelyn's notes do not call for it at this step. However, without the water any semblance of kneading would have been impossible. I kneaded until I could not feel any grainy parts. The dough was incredibly sticky and unruly.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   BATCH 1.
   <br/>
   STEP 3.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <u>
    <em>
     This ready, add to it the residue of the flower, tempering it with water, kneading, allowing it time to rise in every particular governing the work as has already been describ’d.
    </em>
   </u>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At 11:00 pm the same day, I completed the final step of Evelyn's instructions.
   <br/>
   To the mixture in STEP 1, I added (weighed, in a glass beaker, on a small kitchen scale):
   <br/>
   <br/>
   200 grams of Whole Wheat Stone Ground Organic Flour;
   <br/>
   ~210 grams of warm NYC Tap water (Ionized)
   <br/>
   <br/>
   I let the mixture stand until it rose, at approximately 02:00 am. The mixture was lumpy, wet, and sticky. I kneaded it on a wooden cutting board*(it is a BIG mistake to knead on a wooden cutting board because the dough sticks to everything) with ~30 grams of additional Whole Wheat Stone Ground Organic Flour until the lump had the consistency of what I imagine is pizza dough. The dough could still stick into itself, but I felt that if I pushed any more flour into it, it would crumble. I shaped the mass into a mini-baguette.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/128418753@N06/32602769790/in/album-72157678295035352/" rel="nofollow" title="20170216_Grabovskiy_BreadMolding_013">

   <br/>
   I pre-heated an oven to 350 degrees, as recommended by Ken Albala for medieval cookery, and placed into it a cast iron skillet. When the skillet was hot, I lined it with parchment paper on which I placed my raw mini-baguette. This was at 02:38 am, the next day, February 16, 2017.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   I watched until the rising seemed done and the crust seemed hardened enough. At 03:00 am, the crusty top had separated from the spongy bottom. I poked the crusty top and felt a soft fluffy interior.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   I removed the bread from the oven at 03:08 am, and let it cool until 03:18 am.

   I opened up my mini baguette at the tip, and scooped out the pith with a large silver spoon.

   It was warm and almost too hot to handle, almost. Its texture and feel was not terribly different from dough itself, but firmer. I formed a stretch of breadpithe, and keeping it quite thick, firmly pressed a tin soldier figurine into it. The figurine had been cleansed with an isopropyl alcohol wipe beforehand.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/128418753@N06/32602776070/in/album-72157678295035352/" rel="nofollow" title="20170216_Grabovskiy_BreadMolding_017">

   <br/>
   I made a similar, thick lump of breadpith and used it for the back half of the figurine and pressed the figurine back, as it protruded from the first breadpith lump, into the second half. I pierced two corners with toothpicks in order to mark the position of the soldier figurine. I slid the halves apart slightly, removed the soldier, and pressed the halves back together, attached by toothpicks, with a slice of parchment paper in between the impressions. The toothpicks would be necessary for the mold halves to align perfectly when the mold will be formed. I placed the whole contraption in a Ziploc bag to dry slowly.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At 03:47 am, ate warm bread and butter.

   The Poland Spring Batch (BATCH 2) is much more vigorous in kneading and produces a larger lump of dough. The mineral water (BATCH 3) is smaller and stickier after this round of kneading.

   At this point I did realize that I had been adding too much water all along, and that the water should be added bit by bit and not all at once. The dough begins to behave optimally only when the water and flour ratio is perfect.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   I let the dough stand until 01:15 pm, when I found it well risen. I formed BATCH 2 &amp; 3 into round bun shapes and placed them into a pre-heated (350 degrees) oven at 01:30 pm, on February 16, 2017.

   I let the bread cool for 10 minutes and scooped the pithe out of one half of BATCH 2 (Poland Spring) with a silver spoon, and spread it out, 2 inches thick on a wooden cutting board. I took a medal with an impression of a lamp on it, cleaned it with an isopropyl alcohol pad, and placed it face down into the breadpithe. I applied an even pressure, with 6 fingers (3 left, 3 right hand) for 5 minutes onto the medal pressed into the moist, hot pithe.

   The wax ended up getting poured in several layers (one layer had already cooled when the next one began to be poured. So, too, the next one). A faster pour would have perhaps made a more uniform impression. The wax cooled into a dull yellow color.

     SULFUR
    </strong>
   </em>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For the sulfur, I considered a few release agents for the double-sided mold of the army man figurine. For the front portion, I brushed a thin layer of tallow on the dried bread. For the back portion, I sprinkled charcoal powder using a linen bundle. After dipping in the charcoal powder, I tapped the linen bundle, like a cigarette, into the impression for an even coating. I turned over the mold to allow all excess charcoal to fall out.
   <br/>
   Because the bread pith had dried and cracked in many places, the sulfur would have poured out of its many cavities. As a precaution, I enveloped the mold in a clay outer layer, which I made by soaking clay and forming it in a superstructure around the bread. The final result was that the bread was entirely covered by clay except for a gate hole at the top, which connected to the vacant space in the middle of the bread where the impression was.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With Joel's assistance, I poured melted sulfur, under the vent hood, into the gate at the top of the clay/bread pith with a steady and quick hand. When the sulfur overflowed from the gate, I stopped pouring.

    The bread is hard and stiff and crumbles like soft stone at the touch of the dental pick I am using as excavation tool. I used a solid wax spill-over as leverage while maintaining slight upward pressure with the thumb and all the while excavating with the pick. The medal came out in small jerky motions, and I worked around its circumference with the pick. Occasionally, I would work my way around the circumference of the medal pulling up loose areas with my finger. Then, all at once, the bread fell away and the medal was revealed. The design of the original medal was almost invisible, though some striations from the book could be seen in the impression. I sprinkled the medal cast with charcoal dust to make the image more pronounced, and it helped slightly.

     SULFUR
    </strong>
   </em>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The sulfur mold was much harder, perhaps due to the clay. The clay and the bread stuck fast together, and I excavated slowly with a dental pick and a plastic butter knife-like tool. At times, the excavation seemed to proceed crumb by crumb. Sulfur, clay, and bread flew asunder. The (front) side of the cast, which had been treated with tallow, finally came out in one piece. Subsequently, the back side came out as well, but it was stained black with the charcoal dust that had been used as a release agent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Bits of bread were stuck in the crevices of the mold, and I soaked the sulfur cast in water to soften the bread. The cast resembled the original quite well in parts; in other parts, the original shape was obscured by areas of rogue, solidified sulfur and the bottom portion of the legs had failed to cast.
   <br/>
   I then painstakingly removed the small grains of dough that still populate the cast's crevices.

   Notes: a piece of the sulfur mold figurine's gun snapped off in the excavation process. Also, the 2-sided mold (of the figurine) was not aligned properly, which may have happened during the time when its many cracks were being reinforced with clay. The sharpest features in the mold were those that protruded the most in the original figure, and which cut deepest into the pith.
