    Subject: Preparing verdigris recipe
   </strong>
   <br/>
   After reading both Merrifield recipes, I decided to follow #155.
   <br/>
   Materials: ~1/2 c. apple cider vinegar, knife, mason jar, string, and copper plate.
   <br/>
   Process: 1. Since the recipe called for "copper strips" I first decided to strip the copper plate in two by making a slight incision with a knife and then proceeding to manual divide the plate in two. I immediately realized that this was not necessary, but I had first felt that having more than one strip would somehow be truer to the directions. 2. I then filled the jar about half way (slightly less than 1/2 c.) with apple cider vinegar. The recipe called for a strong vinegar and, after a quick taste test, I figured that the apple cider was more acidic than the white wine vinegar in my fridge. The apple cider had been refrigerated and was about 40°F. 3. I then doubled the string and suspended it over the mouth of the jar and placed both copper strips over the string. (Given my long Mondays, it had not occurred to me to simply hook the copper over the string and allow it to suspend vertically down.) 4. The recipe called to place the container "in a warm place, or in dung." My interpretation of this was to place it right next to my nyc apartment's steam radiator, which I estimate can get up to 85°F. While this is definitely one of the warmest (and at times hottest) place in the apartment, the temperature is not consistent. I worry that this might have an effect on the development of the verdigris.

   The strips have already turned a light blue-green color. The radiator has been on for about 30 minutes. Their is condensation on the glass jar and it is warm to the touch.

   The strips have darkened significantly, though the color is not evenly distributed. There is no clear pattern--the strips have been completely coated in a blue-green patina with some areas being more vivid in color than others.

    Subject: Last examination and removal of verdigris
   </strong>
   <br/>
   Process: I collected the jar from next to the radiator and carefully removed the cap. Immediately a strong smell of brassy, rotting acid hit my nose. It was warm, slightly putrid apple cider vinegar--intense, but not terrible. I gently picked up the two strips of copper and placed them on top of a plastic bag.
   <br/>
   Observations: The vividness of the verdigris has developed even more over the last week. In removing the strips, I noticed that the sections that were touching the string did not fully oxidize, though I had expected that. Still, more of it oxidized that I had originally expected.

   </strong>
   <br/>
   <strong>
    Process:
   </strong>
   I began by scraping off the verdigris crystallizations from the strips of copper onto a clear glass plate. The formations were uniform and barely protruded off of the copper. They produced a very fine powder of a vibrant light aqua shade. After having accumulated enough of the powder, I mixed it with 3 drops of linseed oil, applied to the powder with a pipette. Then with a glass muller, I mulled the mixture in a figure-8 motion for 3 minutes. During this process the color of the pigment went from a vibrant aqua blue to a deeper blue-green. I then applied 2 coats of the paint to a gesso board. The color, on first application, was a light blue color, tinged with a slightly green hue.

   ASPECTS TO KEEP IN MIND WHEN MAKING FIELD NOTES
   <br/>
   <ul>
    <li>
     note time
    </li>
    <li>
     note (changing) conditions in the room
    </li>
    <li>
     note temperature of ingredients to be processed (e.g. cold from fridge, room temperature etc.)
    </li>
    <li>
     document materials, equipment, and processes in writing and with photographs
    </li>
    <li>
     notes on ingredients and equipment (where did you get them? issues of authenticity)
    </li>
    <li>
     note precisely the scales and temperatures you used (please indicate how you interpreted imprecise recipe instruction)
    </li>
