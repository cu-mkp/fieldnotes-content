   -at 9pm, swapped out - put that one back in fridge in the sealed container. Removed the other half of the starter, mixed as before, and left overnight in cabinet under cloth.

   Took 1/4 cup starter and mixed with 1/2 wheat flour, 1/4 water - very dry, so added another 1/8 cup water. Covered with cotton towel and set in cabinet. Returned remainder of starter to refrigerator in sealed container.

   Noticed both colonies still less liquid than before. Smell of green apples very intense in sealed container (more liquid than the other, fed less recently...)

   7pm, removed from the refrigerator the bowl from yesterday that had been out for 12 hours:

    <li>
     Didn’t have a chance to take out the bread dough until today - total of 24+24+15=63 hours instead of 12 called for in recipe.
    </li>
    <li>
     I hoped that the extra time in the refrigerator would only mean that the flavors were better-developed, but when I mixed the next set of ingredients - 2 cups flour, 1 tablespoon sugar, and 2.5 tsp salt (adjusted to 3 tsp, or 1 tbsp, because I use kosher salt and the grains are bigger - common practice) - the flour was extremely dry and wouldn't mix, becoming flaky instead. I was leery of adding water. (Further research shows that a) it probably would have been okay to use more water.)
    </li>
    <li>
     I baked one baguette at 425 F fro 25 minutes. It was very dense and chewy. Probably more time in the oven was needed.
    </li>
    <li>
     I left the other baguette under plastic wrap on a floured cutting board to rise - the recipe suggests 4-5 hours, but I left it for 6.5 hours. I reshaped it into a boule because it stuck to the plastic wrape. I baked it for 30 minutes at 425 F and this time it rose, although not evenly.

   Realized that the King Arthur Unbleached Bread Flour I had been using was not actually whole wheat. Swapped it out for Arrowhead Mills Stone Ground Whole Wheat Flour. I have found rye flour, but have decided to keep feeding the starter only with wheat, so that I can experiment with rye ratios and other types during bread baking.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Fed the starter: 1/3 cup starter, 1/3 cup water, 1/3 cup whole wheat flour. Left unrefrigerated beneath loose cling wrap in a glass bowl.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The remainder of the starter was also about 1/3 of a cup. Following the
   <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/extra-tangy-sourdough-bread-recipe" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">
    modern sourdough recipe
   </a>
   for practice, I mixed it with a full cup of flour (thereby keeping the 1:3 ratio of the recipe) and half a cup of lukewarm tap water and left it on the counter in a glass bowl, under a loose cotton towel.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At 2 a.m., ten hours later, I put them both in the refrigerator.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, questions: I have rye flour in order to make the recipe found here:

   <br/>
   "if you are a reasonably prosperous yeoman farmer:
   <br/>
   <strong>
    wholemeal wheat flour
   </strong>
   , which you should mix with
   <strong>
    rye flour
   </strong>
   in random proportions
   <br/>
   (this mixture is now known as maslin)"
   <br/>
   <br/>
   -In keeping with the spirit, should I really mix the rye haphazardly, thereby following the spirit but not tracking my results as easily? Or should I measure? Given that I've been feeding the sourdough only wheat (and earlier, bread flour), I'm not sure already of how much flour is there compared to the dry rye and wheat, so maybe it will be haphazard already.

   Mixed 2/3 cup of whole wheat flour, 1 tsp sugar, 1 tsp Kosher salt in keeping with the thirded recipe. Kneaded, but some flakiness/dryness of the dough. I rolled it into a relatively smooth ball and loosely placed cling wrap over it. The recipes suggests 2-5 hours to rise, but emphasizes that this will depend on many factors. Based on my experience, I think it will need 6-7 hours in my dry apartment with noncommercial yeast.

   Realized the recipe I had been planning to work off of for authentic bread was actually unleavened. I’m having difficulty finding a straightforward English bread recipe (not gingerbread, “French” bread that’s eggy, or other specialty breads that seem unlikely here), so going to follow my previous recipe, but with “maslin.”

   &lt;used this to feed the starter again, pm. The starter was bubbly and smelled of apples, but tasted very bitter/slightly alcoholic
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Since I messed up previously with whole wheat flour, I want to salvage some starter - feeding with the bread flour this time.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   I only had a small amount of sourdough, so after taking 4 oz and feeding, I had 1/6th cup of starter left.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Not much to try baking with!
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Back to the King arthur sourdough recipe, only 1/6th this time
   <br/>
   <br/>
   So, 1/6th cup of starter. 1/4 cup water, and 1/2 cup flour, beat for 1 minute,
   <br/>
   Combined the starter, water, and 3 cups of the flour. Kneaded &amp; covered. Left on the counter for 5 hours, then refrigerated overnight.

   Took out dough and allowed to warm up for 45 minutes. Added the remaining ingredients: 1/3 cup whole wheat flour (no rye, so this is a fancy bread), tsp sugar, tsp kosher salt. Kneaded, and this time added water - just a little, to moisten the dough. This seems to have done the trick as opposed to last time. Allowed to rise until 6:15 pm. Then I made a mistake: I cut the dough in half, because I was paying attention to the recipe and not thinking about the molding. So I have two very small loaves. I let those rise for an hour, then baked them for 30 minutes at 425 F.
   <br/>

   Then I cut the fresh loaves in half, used a spoon to hollow out the four parts, and squeezed the warm pith around two objects - a pendant for a double sided mold, and a brooch for a more complicated single-sided mold. Allowing to dry overnight.
