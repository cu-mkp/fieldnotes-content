   Bouillon (annotated recipe in bold)
   <br/>
   <br/>
   BOUILLON. To make four sixths of bouillon
   <strong>
    (REDUCING BY ~1/5)
   </strong>
   , you need half a brown loaf of bread
   <strong>
    [whole wheat or rye] (1/10 LOAF = 1.5 SLICES OF 15)
   </strong>
   costing one denier[110]
   <strong>
    (REFERENCE WAS LOAF NOT COST)
   </strong>
   , yeast bread
   <strong>
    (YES)
   </strong>
   , raised three days
   <strong>
    (DON’T KNOW)
   </strong>
   : item, bran, a good quarter of a bushel[111]
   <strong>
    (HAVE A LITTLE OVER 1 LBS, SO REDUCING RECIPE IN 5*)
   </strong>
   , and put five sixths of water in a pan
   <strong>
    (BASED ON PAN SIZE, APPROX.)
   </strong>
   , and when it boils, put the bran in the water and boil until it all reduces by a fifth or more
   <strong>
    (AGGRESSIVE BOILING AND SPLASHING WITH ONLY ~1/2 LBS + NOT MUCH H2O LEFT, SO STOPPED THERE —&gt; REDUCE WHOLE RECIPE IN HALF FROM PREVIOUS ESTIMATES)
   </strong>
   ; then take it off the fire
   <strong>
    (OR STOVE)
   </strong>
   and let it cool until it is just warm, then strain through a sieve or cloth
   <strong>
    (CLOTH TO SQUEEZE OUT LIQUID)
   </strong>
   , then soak the leavened bread in water and put it in a cask
   <strong>
    (MY FRIDGE IN BAGS)
   </strong>
   , and leave it for two or three days to work; put in the cellar and leave to clarify, and then drink.
   <br/>
   Item, if you want to make it better, you should add a pint of honey, well boiled and well skimmed.
   <br/>

   Sweet Tisane (annotated recipe in bold)
   <br/>
   <br/>
   SWEET TISANE. Take water and boil it, then add for each sixth of a gallon of water
   <strong>
    [1/6 gallon = 630.9 ml]
   </strong>
   one good bowl of barley
   <strong>
    [TWO OF THESE, ONE FOR LICORICE, ONE FOR FIGS]
   </strong>
   , and it does not (or it does matter? - Trans.) if it still has its hulls
   <strong>
    [WE HAD NO CHOICE]
   </strong>
   , and get two parisis' worth of licorice, item, or figs,
   <strong>
    [CALCULATIONS PERFORMED, BUT THEY DON’T REALLY MATTER, SEE UNITS NOTE BELOW]
   </strong>
   and boil it all until the barley bubbles
   <strong>
    [ESSENTIALLY WHEN COOKED; MIGHT HAVE BOILED LICORICE ONE TOO LONG*]
   </strong>
   ; then let it be strained in two or three cloths,
   <strong>
    [SQUEEZED OUT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE, but harder than for bouillon WHICH IS PROBS WHY WE HAD TO USE CLOTH HERE SPECIFICALLY]
   </strong>
   and put in each goblet a large amount of rock-sugar
   <strong>
    [1 spoonful for fig, 1.5 for licorice]
   </strong>
   . This barley is good to feed to poultry to fatten them.
   <strong>
    [AND XIAOMENG]
   </strong>
   <br/>
   Note that good licorice is the youngest, and when cut is a lively greenish colour, and if it is old it is more insipid and dead, and dry.
   <br/>
   <strong>
    *LICORICE: BOILED TOO LONG SO ADDED “2 GOOD BOWLS” OF H2O EXTRA AND HALF A STICK OF LICORICE MORE
   </strong>
   <br/>
   <strong>
    UNITS: MAYBE PRECISE AMOUNTS DON’T MATTER REALLY, THAT’S WHY IT’S IN TERMS OF PRICE
