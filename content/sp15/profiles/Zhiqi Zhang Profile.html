My name is Zhiqi Zhang. I'm a first year MA student in the socio-cultural anthropology program. My research interest is the interaction between craftsman/artist and material in the creation of an artwork. I'm specifically focusing on the division of labor during the art-making process and trying to contextualize the techniques of the craftsmen who assist the artist in the socialization in their community and the urbanization process of contemporary China. This class has been very inspiring to me and has shed light on my research, by engaging myself with various material, I've learned how to reflect on my embodied knowledge developed through the process and how to theorize and represent it in written words.
