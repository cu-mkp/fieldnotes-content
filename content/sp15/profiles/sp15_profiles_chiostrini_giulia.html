   Giulia Chiostrini is a graduate student at Columbia University under the Medieval and Renaissance Studies Department.
   <br/>
   Considering her professional profile as a textile conservator, Giulia's primary interest is the investigation of a work of art as a particular object born of specific interaction between material, technique, and function.
   <br/>
   She believes that the Making and Knowing project will enhance her ability to understand works of art in relation to the knowledge of artistic practice in the early modern European cultural and historical context.
