    I am a second year Masters student, studying the visual science and the cognitive implications of both making and responding to art and music. I am currently studying music and meditational practices of the Devotio Moderna. I am also currently working part time in Sander Connelly's lab in Columbia's Department of Neuroscience, researching the effects of different components of music therapy on comatose patients. Other projects involve designing course curriculum for art and cognition. In addition to satisfying my curiosity about early modern scientific paradigms, my interest in this course stems from my interest in combining art and science, as well as my interest in learning through making and embodied cognition. I hope to become familiar with the making/knowing pedagogy, in the hopes of applying it to art and cognition.
