<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">SUBJECT:Marchpane reconstruction</span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #5c626d; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 15px;">Zhiqi is in charge of the detailed record of process. </span><br />
<span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #5c626d; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 15px;">And here are some reflections from Shiye </span><br />
<span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #5c626d; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 15px;">1. The ambiguity of the recipe </span><br />
<span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #5c626d; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 15px;">There are some variables that influenced the authenticity of the reconstruction. One of the most crucial variables is what is hiding, excluding from the recipe due to reasons unknown. In our marchpane example, they could be the heating time and temperature of the marchpane. Also, I noticed that the language the recipe applied is always more related to senses but not so-called scientific description. They are more qualitative rather than quantitative. This is another reason why there are always ambiguities. Such kind of descriptions are like invitations sent out by the recipe, inviting practitioners to really do it themselves, which is a fascinating part of the recipe. </span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #5c626d; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 15px;">2. Some other variables come from the different tools we use nowadays. Tools and kitchen appliances are important part of the whole reconstruction process, but it is also where uncertainty lies. For example, how could a stove fire instead of coal fire influence the flavor of a marchpane? Could the electronic grinder have impact on particles of the almond? </span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #5c626d; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 15px;">3. the concept authenticity </span><br />
<span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #5c626d; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 15px;">During reconstruction, I kept thinking about what is authenticity. Is that true when concerning culinary recipe, the authenticity of flavor has a priority over the shape, form, appearance of the food? Is taste has a privilege rather than visual representation? However, it seems to me that the examination of taste is actually more difficult than that of the visual representation, since visualization stands for its own, people can interact with a visual representation of antiquity directly. But for the taste, it always has to be mediated through text. The accuracy or authenticity is thus compromised. After all, who knows exactly how marchpane tasted like in Medieval time, without resorting to the textualization of the flavor?</span><br />

ASPECTS TO KEEP IN MIND WHEN MAKING FIELD NOTES<br />
<ul><li>note time</li><li>note (changing) conditions in the room</li><li>note temperature of ingredients to be processed (e.g. cold from fridge, room temperature etc.)</li><li>document materials, equipment, and processes in writing and with photographs</li><li>notes on ingredients and equipment (where did you get them? issues of authenticity)</li><li>note precisely the scales and temperatures you used (please indicate how you interpreted imprecise recipe instruction)</li><li>see also our <a href="files/Informal%20Template%20for%20Reconstruction.docx">informal template for recipe reconstructions</a></li></ul><hr />
