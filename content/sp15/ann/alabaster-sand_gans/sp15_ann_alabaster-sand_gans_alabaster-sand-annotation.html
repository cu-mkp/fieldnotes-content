<h4 id="toc0"><a name="x---Historical Question:"></a>Historical Question:</h4>
 Why does he refer to alabaster as a different substance for sand from plaster, when he explicitly states that alabaster and plaster are the same thing? What might the connotation of alabaster be? What might its perceived properties be, and how might those have an effect on the choice of material? Is there a substantial difference between making sand from powdered alabaster or powdered gypsum in terms of the final product?<br />

Process:<br />
<ul><li>We had a humidifier and decided to build some sort of tower to place over the humidifier with the sand.<ul><li>We chose terra-cotta plates to hold the sand, as it’s the kind of vessel that would have been used to store powders. Also it absorbs moisture well. We needed three plates, one for alabaster with 1 oz sal ammoniac, one for alabaster with 2oz sal ammoniac, and one for gypsum with 1 oz sal ammoniac.<ul><li>we thought perhaps about using paper, as we knew it would be permeable, but I worried about the integrity of the paper, having it tear and have the sand spill everywhere by accident. Terra-cotta seemed safer.</li></ul></li><li>We built a tower from yogurt containers and milk cartons weighted with water so they’d be stable. We used a food dehydrator tray to hold the terra-cotta plates. We directed the humidifier so it blew directly up through the center of the plates. We covered the plates with another plastic lid, then covered the whole thing in a large swath of linen to trap as much moisture as possible.</li><li>We hope that placing the dry sand in this environment for approximately 7 hours tomorrow will form a paste enough for molding.</li></ul></li></ul><br />

 <ul><li>we first attempted to remove the portrait medal. It was stuck very firmly in the sand, which had become quite smooth and hard. I tried to dislodge it with a pestle, but it still didn’t work, so I used a needle tool to pry it loose. We didn’t use any separators, and a huge chunk of the sand came off with the medal, rendering it effectively useless. There was also evidence of some sort of chemical reaction, as the surface of the medal had begun to turn blue green.</li><li>the next ones all removed fairly easily and seemed to leave a pretty clean impression. The bird necklace also seemed to have some sort of blue green tarnishing.</li></ul><br />

 <ul><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">put the three molds in the kiln at 20 degrees around 9:10am. At 9:33am it was 80 degrees.</span></li></ul><br />
<h5 id="toc17"><a name="x---Heating and Casting-Casting into molds"></a><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Casting into molds</span></h5>
 <br />
<ul><li>decided to cast using lead and tin alloy, referring to recipe on 72v</li><li>we poured a little after 10am using a mixture of approx. 1.5 tin to 1 lead<ul><li>paper test: 139r_c1_c</li><li>laid soapstone over the top of the mold after we poured to put pressure</li></ul></li><li>after letting them rest 20 minutes, we opened the molds<ul><li>the shell had a flaw in the center that seemed to have stemmed from the way the metal was poured, but the detail of the rings of the shell, which wasn’t discernible in the mold itself, was readily apparent in the finished object</li><li>the bird necklace picked up a fair amount of detail in certain areas, but other areas were much less sharp. This seems to have been due to some crumbling that happened in the mold when the object was removed</li><li>the small Madrid medallion wasn’t poured correctly, so the metal pooled weirdly and very little detail was picked up.</li><li>we decided to attempt a second cast into all three molds to see what it would yield.</li></ul></li><li>at 10:42, put the molds back in the kiln at 79 degrees to reheat and cast again. Took them out at 11am, and cast the same mixture, covering the molds with soapstone once the metal was poured.<ul><li>second casts were crumblier and less defined except for the Madrid medal, which was much more evenly cast than the first time.<ul><li>I poured more material with more confidence on the second round, which seems to have made the metal fill the mold better.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><br />
<h4 id="toc18"><a name="x---Conclusions"></a>Conclusions</h4>
 <ul><li>Despite really promising texture after humidifying, it seems that these sands don't pick up quite as cleanly as some of the other sands we've worked with. They crumbled slightly when the objects were removed from them, and the detail was generally lacking fineness in certain areas.</li><li>All sands used seemed to work equally well despite differences in material, technique, and ratios. There didn't seem to be a quantifiable difference between alabaster, gypsum, or amounts of sal ammoniac.<ul><li>it would have been nice to be able to cast the same object in each type of sand, as that could have allowed for more direct comparison.</li></ul></li><li>we were able to cast twice into the molds and pick up at least some detail on the second cast, which isn't always the case.</li><li>we could/should perhaps try a separator next time to see if it results in finer detail and less crumbling on release.</li></ul><br />
