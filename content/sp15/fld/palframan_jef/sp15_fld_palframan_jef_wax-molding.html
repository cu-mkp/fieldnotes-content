       The molding of this semester’s wax model was completed using exactly the same method as last semester. For a description of this method see

       on sand casting. The only real differences in this iteration were the additional pigment added to the wax and a few improvements to the technique.

       The addition of coloring to the wax made it the material a better medium for sculpting. Last semester, the yellow wax was too translucent to be judged accurately by the eye; edges and thick parts of the model were difficult to judge for depth and position. The addition of the pigment Venice Red made the wax more apparent to the eye; making depth and position easier judge. As well, this pigment also added a contrast of shadows making the pieces and protrusions stand out better than before.

       An additive process was used again to construct the model. In last semester’s iteration the model fell apart on transferring to clay. This was due to additional pieces not being heated enough before application. This semester, I made the pieces thicker and applied more heat with the candle before application to the was base. In this way the pieces had a larger amount of liquid wax on them that allowed them to stick better to the base.
