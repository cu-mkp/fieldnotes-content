     Discussion on Procedure:
     <ul>
      <li>
       The recipe states "
       <span style="font-family: ArialMT; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5;">
        You must have some millet soaked in order to remove the chaff and then clean it well" (p020r). The millet we bought was preprepared for cooking. It had already been cleaned from chaff and removed from the stalk. It is unknown how soaking during the cleaning process would have affected the taste of the millas. This could be tested with actually obtaining some raw millas.

    <ul>
     <li>
      The millet was ground with mortar and pestle. The Millet was extremely difficult to grind and only yielded about a cup of flour after 1 hour of grinding. It is more than likely that the practitioner had a grinder that would have saved the labor. We ground around three cups of flour and sifted it through three layer of cheese cloth.
     </li>
     <li>
      The recipe states "
      <span style="font-family: ArialMT;">
       <span style="font-family: ArialMT; line-height: 1.5;">
        Afterwards you must have some molds, which must be made from terra[cotta], like a furnace for catholic hats but it must be open at both ends. And then, having made a good fire, clean where you want to put your millas and then take your molds and grease them very well so that the pastry does not stick to them when baked.
        <span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5;">
         Once you have done that, put your molds in a place in the oven where you clean and sprinkle a bit of flour on the bottom and fill them with some of the aforementioned pastry. Then you will cover the said molds, with a lid made like the mould, but it must be bigger and not open at the top
        </span>
       </span>
       <span style="line-height: 1.5;">
        " (p020r).
       </span>
       <span style="line-height: 20px;">
        This portion of the recipe was not clear. It was clear that we should have molds, but there was discussion about how the phrase
       </span>
       'like a furnace for catholic hats' fit into the recipe, or how a lid was 'open at both ends.'
      </span>
     </li>
     <li>
      <span style="font-family: ArialMT;">
       In order to test the phrasing we decided to perform three different iterations of the experiment. First was a mini furnace that would mimic a catholic hat, or as close as we could get. The second was for a mold that could shape the millas into bite-sized biscuit and will be cooked without a lid. The third was a covered mold for a larger milas cake.

       Like other early modern recipes the quantities are not specified in the recipe from the Ms. Because the Ms. states that the dough should be light like "

       e decided to utilize a contemporary recipe for beignets to estimate the amounts. The recipe can be found at:

       The results of the experiment were less than appetizing. The millas smelt nice, but had a bitter aftertaste. The molds worked well and it would be possible to mold some interesting shapes with the terracotta. The mold-ability and ornamentation of the recipe again suggests that the author was involved with displaying his works. It is also possible that the millas could not have been intended to be consumed and were another example of ornamentation.

      <li>
       Since this recipe will be attempted again in preparation for writing an annotation, we will vary the mixture during the next attempt. We may try less milk, more butter, and more egg yolks.
