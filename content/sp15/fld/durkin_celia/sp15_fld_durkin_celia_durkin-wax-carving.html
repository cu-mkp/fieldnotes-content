clay molding of carved wax medal<br />
--rolled out clay to a thick round--2-3 inches thick<br />
--rubbed wax medal with soap as separator, pressed medal into clay<br />
--first attempt was not deeply pressed enough<br />
--tried two more times, each time the impression came out distorted<br />
--then tried oil as a separator, made sure to oil sides, and then the medal released, with original shape imprinted<br />
<br />
Plaster mixing<br />
--mixed 1 cup plaster to 1/2 cup water<br />
first attempt did not work, as set plaster was left over in bowl from last mixing<br />
--used new bowl, upped water ratio <br />
--filled mold with plaster, tapping plate along the way<br />
--waited for plaster to set
