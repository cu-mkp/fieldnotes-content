The results were much better than last semester, proving that even a minute amount of separator can have a large impact.</li><li>Giulia grew the sour dough starter per Dr. Smith’s instructions, the night before. See her field notes on the subject for further information.</li><li>We combined 2 cups of sour dough starter, 1 Tbs of salt, and 3 ½ cups of all purpose unbleached flour in a mixing bowl and stirred for 10 mins.</li></ul></li></ul><span style="display: block; text-align: center;"><img src="files/WIN_20150204_181128.JPG" alt="WIN_20150204_181128.JPG" title="WIN_20150204_181128.JPG" style="width: 400px;" /><img src="files/WIN_20150204_183435.JPG" alt="WIN_20150204_183435.JPG" title="WIN_20150204_183435.JPG" style="width: 400px;" /></span><span style="display: block; text-align: left;"><br />
<ul><ul><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">The dough was removed from the bowl and </span>kneaded<span style="line-height: 1.5;"> on a cutting board for 20 mins.

The dough in the bread pan was observed to have risen, dried out, cracked, and then fallen. Brushing the top of the dough with some olive oil would have mitigated this.</li></ul></li></ul><div style="text-align: center"><img src="files/WIN_20150205_181438.JPG" alt="WIN_20150205_181438.JPG" title="WIN_20150205_181438.JPG" style="width: 400px;" /></div><ul><ul><li>The dough in the bread pan was placed in the oven at 400° for 30 mins. It was then removed from the oven, removed from its pan and cut in-half as soon as it was cool enough to handle. Knowing, from last semester, that impressing the object as soon as possible is best for obtaining a good imprint, we tried to do the impressions as hot as we could without burning our hands. The object we molded were a key and a medallion. <img src="files/WIN_20150205_185406.JPG" alt="WIN_20150205_185406.JPG" title="WIN_20150205_185406.JPG" style="width: 400px;" /><img src="files/WIN_20150205_185541.JPG" alt="WIN_20150205_185541.JPG" title="WIN_20150205_185541.JPG" style="width: 400px;" /></li><li>Before impress in the objects a thin layer of olive oil was applied to the objects before pressing. It was observed that the objects released easier than previous experiments. Again, this illustrates that separating agents are an essential component to molding and casting. <img src="files/WIN_20150205_192218.JPG" alt="WIN_20150205_192218.JPG" title="WIN_20150205_192218.JPG" style="width: 400px;" /><img src="files/WIN_20150205_195910.JPG" alt="WIN_20150205_195910.JPG" title="WIN_20150205_195910.JPG" style="width: 400px;" /></li><li>Reflecting upon the recipes in the Ms., it was noted that this kind of molding could be a form of prototyping possibly as part of a larger project. What was the purpose of &quot;trying it in bread first”? Could it provide a model to be used in a larger multi-piece mold? How large could an object be for this type of molding? What about holding dimensions at a larger size. Thus, it was decided to try a much larger piece than a key or medallion.</li><li>The other dough, which was double in size from the original, was placed in the oven, on a cookie sheet at 400° for 60 mins, then it was removed and set to cool until it could be handled.</li></ul></ul><br />
