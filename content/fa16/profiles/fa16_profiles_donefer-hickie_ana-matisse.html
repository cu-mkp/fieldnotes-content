   I am currently a second year Masters Student at the Bard Graduate Center: History of Design, Decorative Arts, and Material Culture. I graduated in 2015 with an undergraduate degree was a Combined Honours in History of Science and Technology and History at the University of King's College in Halifax Nova Scotia. My honours thesis considered the role that the proliferation of factory produced transparent glassware in 19th C England played in the rise in public preference for "fine, sparkling" ale. I am interested in the place of glass in society, including the making, use of, and thought about the material. I am currently working on the hofglash√ºtte of Archduke Ferdinand II at Schloss Ambras and the glass object produced there that became part of his collection. I am particularly interested in pursuing research on the materials science of 15th and 16th century glassmaking recipes and their relationship to the history of alchemy.
