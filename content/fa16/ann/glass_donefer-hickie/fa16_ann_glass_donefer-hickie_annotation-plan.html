<strong>English:</strong> &lt;head&gt;For cages&lt;/head&gt; &lt;ab&gt; You can embellish them with &lt;m&gt;thin&lt;/m&gt; &lt;m&gt;enamel&lt;/m&gt; &lt;m&gt;canes&lt;/m&gt;[a][b][c] of various colors by covering the &lt;m&gt;yellow latten&lt;/m&gt; or &lt;m&gt;iron&lt;/m&gt; wire with said canes. These you will break neatly into the length that you want if you make a small notch with a cutting &lt;tl&gt;file&lt;/tl&gt; at the point where you want to break them, and they will not break anywhere else. You can bend them with a &lt;m&gt;wood&lt;/m&gt; en model over a brazier or by the heat of a &lt;tl&gt;lamp&lt;/tl&gt;. A cane can be stretched out as long as you want in a small &lt;tl&gt;furnace&lt;/tl&gt; made like a &lt;tl&gt;reverberatory oven&lt;/tl&gt; but with openings on both sides. And once the large cane is red, they seize the hot end of it with &lt;tl&gt;small pincers&lt;/tl&gt; that have long beaks, with one end of the beak inside the end of the cane, so that it may be stretched without becoming blocked[d]. The other end of the cane is held with the hand, as it is not hot. Once the cane is stretched enough, the one who is working seated with his &lt;tl&gt;stove&lt;/tl&gt;, the size of a carnation pot, placed in front of him, breaks it off and carries on.<br />
<strong>French:</strong> &lt;head&gt;Pour &lt;del&gt;ga cach&lt;/del&gt; cages[a]&lt;/head&gt; &lt;ab&gt;Tu les peulx embellir avecq des &lt;m&gt;canulles&lt;/m&gt; d&lt;m&gt;esmail&lt;/m&gt; de diverses&lt;lb/&gt; couleurs en revestant le &lt;m&gt;fil darchal&lt;/m&gt; ou de &lt;m&gt;fer&lt;/m&gt; desdictes canulles&lt;lb/&gt; Lesquelles tu rompras nettement a telle longueur que tu vouldras&lt;lb/&gt; si tu encoches un petit lendroict a rompre avecq une &lt;tl&gt;lime&lt;/tl&gt; qui&lt;lb/&gt; couppe Et ne se rompront poinct en aultre endroict Tu les[b] peulx&lt;lb/&gt; courber avecq un modelle de &lt;m&gt;bois&lt;/m&gt; sur un rechault ou bien a la&lt;lb/&gt; chaleur de la &lt;tl&gt;lampe&lt;/tl&gt; Il se tire aussi si long que tu veulx da{n}s&lt;lb/&gt; un petit &lt;tl&gt;fourneau&lt;/tl&gt; faict comme un &lt;tl&gt;four de reverberation&lt;/tl&gt; qui&lt;lb/&gt; touteffois est perce des deulx costes Et quand la grosse canulle&lt;lb/&gt; est rouge ilz empoignent le bout chault avecq des &lt;tl&gt;pincettes&lt;/tl&gt; a&lt;lb/&gt; long bec de sorte quune poincte du bec de la pincette entre deda{n}s&lt;lb/&gt; le bout de la canulle &amp; par ainsy il salonge sans se boucher&lt;lb/&gt; &amp; laultre bout de la canulle se tient avecq la main pourceque&lt;lb/&gt; elle nest poinct chaulde Quand la canulle est assez estiree&lt;lb/&gt; celuy qui travaille assis ayant son &lt;tl&gt;fourneau&lt;/tl&gt; de la gra{n}deur&lt;lb/&gt; dun pot doeillets devant luy la rond &amp; continue Cest pour&lt;lb/&gt; faire canulles pour cappes qui se couppent comme dict est avecq&lt;lb/&gt; la &lt;tl&gt;lime&lt;/tl&gt; Les &lt;pro&gt;boutonniers aussi de verre&lt;/pro&gt; saident dudit &lt;tl&gt;fourneau&lt;/tl&gt;&lt;/ab&gt;<br />
<br />
[AMDH] I have also made <a class="wiki_link" href="Donefer-Hickie%20-%20G%20FA16.html">a list of recipes that mention glass</a> EXCLUDING glassware (cups, vials, mortar&amp;pestle, etc. - there are a lot of these), recipes for painting on glass (except when the nature of the material is explictly discussed), and looking-glass tin (which I think is the tin-alloy used to mirror glass, but more research on that process will be necessary for me to be sure). These will help us place glass in the author/practitioner's workshop as well as sort out the differences between &quot;glass&quot; and &quot;enamel&quot; in the author practitioner's understandings of vitreous materials.<br />
We will also compile a list of the recipes involving the catching and care of lizards, snakes, and birds, as this may have been a potential use for these cages.<br />
<br />
3. <strong>Research Plan:</strong><br />
<ul><li>Historical: Historical research will focus on the possible uses of a cage like this, on the presence of glass/enamel in the workshop, and the networks of exchange that may have led to the author/practitioner's knowledge of glass and glass-making. We suspect this cage may have been used to house birds, so in addition to studying the recipes that concern the catching and care of animals in 640, we will research bird collecting in other sources to see if we can find any other recipes or instructions for making cages in different kinds of manuals. AMDH is interested in the use of glass in the author/practitioner's workshop. He is obviously familiar with the glass industry in Lorraine and the equipment and materials that glassmakers use. We will research the French glass industry and guild system in an attempt to determine where he was likely to obtain glass materials, whether he was likely to have melted his own glass (possibly since he mentions making false gemstones), and how he obtained such detailed knowledge of glassmaking technology and materials. In addition, more research on the techniques used by sixteenth century perlieri (lampworkers) will be necessary to supplement our reconstruction.</li><li>Object Based: We have already found an object that is similar to the cage described in the recipe. This cage, currently in the Kunst Historisches Museum Sammlungen Schloss Ambras (Inv.-Nr. PA 1184), is from the collection of Ferdinand II of Tyrol and was made in the second half of the 16th C by the Venetian perlieri working in his Glash√ºtte (glass house). There are several other objects from this collection (made in the same glasshouse) that exhibit similar delicate lampworking techniques. Though it houses a Glasberg (glass mountain; a false Handstein made from crushed glass with small lampworked figures on it), the bars of the cage are made of glass, or potentially glass fired over metal wires. We will research decorative cages in the other collections of Continental Europe to see if there are equivalents [AMDH - this is the only one I've ever seen and Ferdinand's collection is pretty idiosyncratic], whether they house Glasbergen or were meant for birds. Finding other object examples will help us research other types of cages (whether decorative or functional) and the materials used to manufacture and decorate them (were they often made of glass? Why? Glass is fragile so it hardly seems practical if the cage was actually meant to hold animals). This object also raises the question of networks of knowledge exchange. It was made in Austria by Venetian artisans. If this is the kind of cage that the author/practitioner is describing, then that means the knowledge of this recipe is common in Italy, Austria, and France. How did it travel? This is also a question that we will explore in our historical research.</li></ul><br />

<br />
<ul><li>Hands On: We are most interested in the author-practitioner's knowledge of glassmaking and working, so we will attempt to follow the recipe to pull glass/enamel canes as he describes and fire them onto metal wires.</li></ul><br />
4. <strong>Materials:</strong><br />
<ul><li>Heat source - &quot;brazier,&quot; &quot;heat of a lamp,&quot; &quot;a small furnace made like a reverberatory oven&quot;: The heat source will be tricky. An open flame (preferably like a lampworking torch because the heat can be adjusted) will probably do for the brazier/heat of a lamp. A lamp probably refers to the lamps used by perlieri. More research is necessary on what these looked like [i.e. AMDH thinks but has not verified that the technology available in the late 16th century is actually similar to the lampworking desks used by the Blaschka's, an example of which is in the Corning Museum of Glass]. A reverberatory oven is a metallurgical furnace that isolates the material being processed from contact with fuel, but not from contact with combustion gases. More research on early modern ovens will be necessary. [AMDH - Ercker's Treatise on Ores and Assaying might have something on this]. We may have to contact UrbanGlass to see if we can have time on one of their torches [AMDH - I have contacts there, I might be able to get us time for free].</li><li>Enamel/glass canes - &quot;enamel canes of various colors&quot;: We can probably pull thin canes from the standard canes of soft lampworking glass. In the recipe they seem to be hollow (since he recommends putting one of the beaks of a pincers into the cane). It will take some discussion with a professional lampworker to see what is possible in this regard. We can obtain glass canes from Ana Matisse's mother, who is a glass artist. The glass itself poses interesting historical problems, as the chemical composition of contemporary glass is different from early modern glass and [AMDH thinks but has not verified] has a higher melting point, which may make its workability different.</li><li>Wire - &quot;latten or iron wires&quot;: latten is an alloy of copper and zinc. Metal wires purchased from a craft supply store or from amazon may suffice, though we would have to look into their composition. Stiff wire can usually be purchased from craft supply or hardware stores.</li><li>Pincers - &quot;small pincers that have long beaks&quot;: These sound like pretty standard lampworking tweezers [AMDH - many of the glassmaking tools used today are the same as the ones used in the early modern period. I think I can obtain some at no cost from friends/family. If not, if we do rent time at Urban we can probably rent tools as well.]</li><li>Wooden model - &quot;wooden model&quot;: Perhaps of a house or cage shape? We could perhaps use a wooden bird house from a craft supply store or from amazon (one of those small decorative ones made to be painted at home).</li></ul><br />

<strong>Towards a Finalized Annotation Plan (Draft #2)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Research Questions:</strong> To investigate the sources of the author/practitioner‚Äôs understanding of glassworking (particularly lampworking) techniques, vitreous materials, and tools. We will look at fol.6r, 36v, and 37v, which all describe glassworking techniques. The reconstruction will focus on re-creating the techniques he describes for pulling enamel canes, and comparing these to 16th century lampworking techniques from other sources.<br />
<br />
<strong>Recipes:</strong><br />
<strong>6r:</strong><br />
See above.<br />
<strong>36v:</strong><br />
&lt;head&gt;&lt;pro&gt;Glassmakers&lt;/pro&gt;' glass&lt;/head&gt; &lt;ab&gt;It is said that in &lt;pl&gt;Lorraine&lt;/pl&gt; and &lt;pl&gt;Flanders&lt;/pl&gt; &lt;m&gt;linking glass&lt;/m&gt; is made of &lt;m&gt;fern ashes&lt;/m&gt; and &lt;m&gt;pebbles&lt;/m&gt;. First they blow up a long still that another worker breaks off and cuts vertically with big shears. Then this long still expands by being placed on a stone or large platine in a furnace slightly colder than one for melting. Furthermore, they flatten it by rolling &lt;sup&gt;over&lt;/sup&gt; it a big and long iron stick. Then they take it out of the annealing furnace. Similarly, they make some in &lt;pl&gt;England&lt;/pl&gt; that are quite beautiful. Close to &lt;pl&gt;Rouen&lt;/pl&gt; in &lt;pl&gt;France&lt;/pl&gt;, flat glass is made with some &lt;m&gt;saltworth&lt;/m&gt; and &lt;m&gt;pebbles&lt;/m&gt; and is whiter and softer than the &lt;pl&gt;Lorraine&lt;/pl&gt; one, because it can be melted with a candle, unlike the &lt;pl&gt;Lorraine&lt;/pl&gt; one. This flat &lt;m&gt;glass&lt;/m&gt; is blown up in a long still -- the end of which someone else cuts and blows up whilst turning it, then flattens it using a plane which is on the ground, and then reheats it. Thus the middle of the still, where it began, always stays the same.&lt;/ab&gt; &lt;ab&gt;&lt;margin&gt;left-middle&lt;/margin&gt;The &lt;m&gt;glass&lt;/m&gt;, when wet, can be broken again with the flame of a candle, but not as precisely as with hot iron.&lt;/ab&gt; &lt;/div&gt;<br />
<strong>037v:</strong> &lt;div&gt; &lt;id&gt;p037v_2&lt;/id&gt; &lt;head&gt;&lt;pro&gt;Glass-maker&lt;/pro&gt;&lt;/head&gt; &lt;ab&gt; Some do not lay &lt;m&gt;gris d'escaille&lt;/m&gt; on the &lt;m&gt;glass&lt;/m&gt; to work on it, but trace straight on the &lt;m&gt;glass&lt;/m&gt; with &lt;m&gt;noir √† huile&lt;/m&gt;. However, it is important that the &lt;m&gt;wood&lt;/m&gt; be &lt;m&gt;degreased&lt;/m&gt;, because if it has even a little &lt;m&gt;grease&lt;/m&gt; [on it], the color will not take at all. And even, if the working &lt;pro&gt;glass-maker&lt;/pro&gt; has a stink from his nose or his mouth, and he breathes on the &lt;m&gt;glass&lt;/m&gt;, the color will not take on it. <strong>Those who came up with the invention of working in small works of softened &lt;m&gt;enamels&lt;/m&gt; use only &lt;m&gt;azure enamel&lt;/m&gt;, which is blue, and &lt;m&gt;esmail colombin&lt;/m&gt;, which is the color of purple, which they soften with &lt;m&gt;rocks&lt;/m&gt; or &lt;m&gt;lead glass&lt;/m&gt;</strong>. As for yellow, they make it from &lt;m&gt;silver&lt;/m&gt;, red from &lt;m&gt;sanguine&lt;/m&gt;, as is said elsewhere, black and gray and shadows from &lt;m&gt;scale black&lt;/m&gt;, either strong or weak, carnation from light &lt;m&gt;sanguine&lt;/m&gt;. Green is made first from yellow, then they overlay &lt;m&gt;azure enamel&lt;/m&gt;, either strong or weak, depending on whether they want to make it bright or dark. &lt;/ab&gt;&lt;/div&gt;<br />

<br />
<strong>Hands-On Reconstruction Plan</strong><br />
<strong>Purpose:</strong> The reconstruction will focus on the second half of the recipe on fol. 6r, since it seems like the one that the author/practitioner most likely experimented with himself and the most feasible for us to do with the resources available.<br />
<strong>Participants:</strong> Ana Matisse Donefer-Hickie and Caitlyn Sellar<br />
<strong>Venue:</strong> Lab<br />
<strong>Meeting Time(s):</strong> TBD<br />
<br />
<strong>Materials</strong><br />
<ol><li>‚Äúthin enamel canes‚Äù<ul><li>We have decided to use pre-made Moretti soda-lime silica glass (or ‚Äúsoft‚Äù glass) canes.</li><li>Fol. 6v and fol. 37v seem to use the term enamel to refer to hard, vitreous enamel softened in the heat of a flame. Sources relating to sixteenth-century lampworking techniques are scarce, but the author-practitioner‚Äôs use of the term accords with a description of lampworking in Denis Diderot‚Äôs 1759 Encyclopedie. Diderot describes an ‚Äúenameler‚Äù fusing ‚Äúbaguette[‚Äòs] of solid enamel‚Äù onto ‚Äúsmall structures of brass wire‚Äù to make small human or animal figures.</li><li>According to Grei√üer et. al. (2012), soda-lime silica glass is the same type (if not exact chemical composition) of the glass used in the late sixteenth-century lampworked objects from the collection of Ferdinand II.</li><li>According to Turgeon‚Äôs (2001) study of the 16th c inventories of Parisian beadmakers, most lampworking workshops lacked the equipment to make glass and enamel canes themselves, and would have ordered them ready-made from glass manufacturing houses. It is likely that the author/practitioner, if he did this himself, ordered the glass canes from somewhere else. It also seems like he is describing the process of making the canes, something that will hopefully become clearer as we carry on with the reconstruction.</li><li>I would like to go over the chemistry of this with Naomi to make sure.</li></ul></li><li>‚Äúyellow latten or iron wire‚Äù<ul><li>It is likely that latten wire refers to wires made from cutting up sheets of latten, an alloy.</li><li>We will use iron wire, as it can be ordered from Amazon (I haven‚Äôt done this yet).</li></ul></li></ol><br />
Tools/Equipment<br />
<ol><li>‚Äúa small furnace made like a reverberatory oven but with openings on both sides‚Äù<ul><li>The author/practitioner mentions reverberatory furnaces in 16r, 115v, 124v, 127v, and 161r.</li><li>It seems that by ‚Äúreverberatory‚Äù furnace he means a furnace with good airflow, an even heat, and at least marginally controllable temperature (he talks about them with reference to several kinds of heat - more research into the author/practitioner‚Äôs knowledge of heat would be interesting here).</li><li>I think we can make a similar one (with the help of the post-docs and perhaps Hunter from RISD) with the blowtorches and firebricks already in the lab. I haven‚Äôt completed a safety workflow for this yet because I have some questions for the team about what is possible in the space we have.</li></ul></li><li>‚Äúsmall pincers that have long beaks‚Äù<ul><li>There are diagrams in fol. 167r of the manuscript depicting small pincers, and they are mentioned several times throughout for manipulating small animals for life casting.</li><li>I have obtained a pair of similar, but not identical, pincers. They are made particularly for lampworking, though I do not know their particular metal composition.</li></ul></li><li>‚Äúcutting file‚Äù<ul><li>This is a technique familiar to me for cutting both glass and wire in a modern studio. A small metal file is used to make wires easier to cut. I will look into ordering one from Amazon, if the lab doesn‚Äôt already have one.</li><li>I also think modern wire cutters or a hardy nail file might suffice here, since this step is not integral to our questions.</li></ul></li><li>‚Äúwooden model‚Äù<ul><li>Since I am more interested in his knowledge of the manipulation of glass, I have not thought extensively about the model. I think we could probably make one out of scraps of wood.</li></ul></li><li>‚Äúbrazier‚Äù or ‚Äúlamp‚Äù<ul><li>From the breadmolding exercise we know that a brazier is a container for coals. This implies a strong, diffuse, stable heat. We could try to use an oven on high heat for this part.</li></ul></li></ol><br />
<strong>Preliminary Recipe Analysis and Instructions Breakdown [and commentary]</strong><br />
<ol><li>&lt;ab&gt;You can embellish them with &lt;m&gt;thin&lt;/m&gt;&lt;m&gt;enamel&lt;/m&gt;&lt;m&gt;canes&lt;/m&gt; of various colors by <strong>covering</strong> the &lt;m&gt;yellow latten&lt;/m&gt; or &lt;m&gt;iron&lt;/m&gt; wire with said canes.<ul><li>Here the author/practitioner is laying out the purpose of the whole recipe. This is essentially a description of the intended final product.</li><li>What does he mean by &quot;covering&quot;?</li></ul></li><li>These you will break neatly into the length that you want if you make a small notch with a cutting &lt;tl&gt;file&lt;/tl&gt; at the point where you want to break them, and they will not break anywhere else.<ul><li>It is not clear here whether the author/practitioner is talking about the wires or the canes. I think he is talking about the wires and not yet about the glass. This section seems to be instructions for how to make a cage out of stiff wire, the next instructions for how to make glass canes.</li><li>AMENDMENT: He is talking about the canes, since he re-iterates the point later in the recipe.</li></ul></li><li>You can bend them with a &lt;m&gt;wood&lt;/m&gt;en model over a brazier or by the heat of a &lt;tl&gt;lamp&lt;/tl&gt;.<ul><li>Do wires need to be heated to bend? Is the glass already on the wires? The heat given off by a brazier would not be directed, it would be diffuse. Obviously it is cool enough to prevent the wooden model from catching fire but hot enough to bend something (wire? Glass-covered wire?).</li><li>Bending the canes? Is there wire in the canes?</li></ul></li><li>A cane can be stretched out as long as you want in a small &lt;tl&gt;furnace&lt;/tl&gt; made like a &lt;tl&gt;reverberatory oven&lt;/tl&gt; but with openings on both sides.<ul><li>Here he switches from his description of how to form the cage-shape to his description of how to pull out canes. At first I thought that he meant the reader to pull out canes with wire already inside them, but now I think he means to simply lay the colorful cane on top of the pre-formed wire cage.</li></ul></li><li>And once the large cane is red, they seize the hot end of it with &lt;tl&gt;small pincers&lt;/tl&gt; that have long beaks, with one end of the beak inside the end of the cane, so that it may be stretched without becoming blocked.<ul><li>With this sentence, he switches from using ‚Äúyou‚Äù in his descriptions of the actions to be taken to using ‚Äúthey.‚Äù This suggests a switch from instruction to description. I think here he is describing the actions of glass artisans making hollow canes. He describes the actions of glassmakers at least twice more in the manuscript, in 36v and 37v.</li><li>Being stretched without becoming blocked implies that the canes are hollow when they are stretched.</li></ul></li><li>The other end of the cane is held with the hand, as it is not hot.<ul><li>This completely accords with my knowledge of lampworking, where you manipulate the glass by holding the canes with just the end of the cane in the flame to be worked hot.</li></ul></li><li>Once the cane is stretched enough, the one who is working seated with his &lt;tl&gt;stove&lt;/tl&gt;, the size of a carnation pot, placed in front of him, breaks it off and carries on.<ul><li>So here is information on where the oven is located while the glass is being worked. It sounds like perhaps there are two people involved in this process, one holding the cane on one side of the furnace and one holding the cane on the other side of the furnace. The one who is seated hold the original cane because it is he that breaks it off, while the second artisan is the one that draws the end through the stove. What is odd here is that he describes and depicts them drawing the glass cane through the stove. I would think it would get too hot and melt into the furnace.</li></ul></li><li>This is for making canes for capes, which may be cut, as already mentioned, with a &lt;tl&gt;file&lt;/tl&gt;.<ul><li>I do not know what he means by cape here. Further research on this might help us determine what kind of canes he is talking about.</li><li>This part also suggests that what he is talking about cutting in the first part is the canes, not the wire.</li></ul></li><li>&lt;pro&gt;Glass-button makers&lt;/pro&gt; also use the said &lt;tl&gt;stove&lt;/tl&gt;.&lt;/ab&gt;<ul><li>He mentions both button-makers and enamel again on fol. 40r. In that recipe, however, he does not describe heating and working cold enamel rods but painting a crushed enamel paste onto silver gild lozenges and firing. This accords with the similarities between his descriptions of this furnace and his descriptions of using reverberatory furnaces for firing molds in fol. 115v, 124v, 127v, and 161r.</li></ul></li><li>Under the door is a grill that supports the burning &lt;m&gt;charcoal&lt;/m&gt;. The &lt;m&gt;ash&lt;/m&gt; is emptied by turning the &lt;tl&gt;stove&lt;/tl&gt; upside down.&lt;/ab&gt;<ul><li>The recipe is accompanied by a marginal note including details on the furnace. It is clear from this that the furnace is heated with charcoal that is supported by a grill. I think the stove can be removed from the grate (turned upside down) and the ash brushed off the grate to be replaced with fresh charcoal.</li><li>This stove seems very similar to the pipe stove that Hunter built in the RISD Ruby Glass trials.</li></ul></li></ol><br />
<strong>Summary of Breakdown and Plan for Iterations of Reconstruction Experiment</strong><br />
<ul><li>I will divide the recipe into two parts, the one that describes making canes and the one that describes embellishing the cage. Since my research question involves the author/practitioner‚Äôs knowledge of glassworking techniques, I want to start by reconstructing the methods he describes for pulling cane in order to think about whether he did this himself after observing or whether he just observed it. This will be complemented with historical research on glassworking in France during the 16th c. Then if time permits I will go back and look at the part of the recipe that engages specifically with the cage form later if there is time (this may have to be left to a future annotation).</li><li>We will have to start with building a ‚Äúsmall furnace made like a reverberatory oven but with openings on both sides. I have an idea of how to do this, but I will have to talk further with the making and knowing team about it. The safety protocol will be tied to the heat source we decide on, since that is the main safety concern (i.e. - we are not melting our own glass so we are not using any chemicals).</li><li>Then we will start by attempting to reconstruct steps 4-7 with the furnace and the glass and tweezers I have already obtained.</li><li>I'd like to try several iterations of the glassworking section of the recipe, including one using solid tubes, one using hollow tubes (I have contacted a lampworker at UrbanGlass about helping us understand how to do this), one using one person, and one using two people.</li><li>Once the first phase is completed, we will look at trying to reconstruct the first half of the recipe, steps 1-3.</li></ul><br />
<strong>Research Plan</strong><br />
Ongoing research can be found in my research notes, which I have moved to another wiki page because it seemed like too much to keep all in one place:<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;"><a class="wiki_link" href="Research%20Notes_AMDH%20FA16.html">AMDH's Research Notes Found Here.</a></span></strong><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">I plan to undertake further research on: </span><br />
<ul><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Recipe Genealogy: This is tough because of the source material I have perused (Cennini, Theophilus, Neri, Mappae Clavicula) most mentions of glass or enamel do not relate to working techniques but to recipes for melting glass. Biringuccio, Agricola, and Olivier de la Marche all do mention the fabrication of small glass figurines. I need to look for more descriptions of glassworkers forming the material, since this seems to be what the author/practitioner is describing.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Historical: I have found some sources but still need more information on beadmaking, lampworking, and glassmaking/working activities in France during this period. </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Object: I have found several late 16th C lampworked objects (including some buttons) but they are from Germany. The only ones I could find from France are figurines from Nevers but they are from the 18th C.
