   <span style="font-size: 120%;">
    Following the instructions of the recipe, I cut out a piece of canvas that is about four or five fingers in width and sewed the two sides of it together to form a tube that can fit in my index finger. Then I sewed up one end of the tube and filled in short-grain Japanese rice. However, my sausage ended up looking like a long fabric bag. Donna sewed another piece of canvas surrounding a wooden rod and hers did look more like a tube.
   </span>
   <br/>
   <span style="font-size: 120%;">
    The tightly woven linen canvas I used for the reconstruction held the grains of rice very well, even though I only sewed by simple, straight running stitches that did not overlap. Neither did I need to make back stitch to reinforce the seam. However, while the recipe specifies that one should use “buckram selvage”for sewing, I did not create a selvage for the edges of the canvas after cutting it out to prevent the fabric from unraveling. Therefore, the canvas edges appeared to be fraying as I sewed. After making the tube, I stitched a string of twine onto the sausage body as well as another piece of canvas that is the size of my palm (noted as “empan” in the French original) onto the open end of the sausage, which I then cut in the middle in accordance with the instructions of the recipe. However, since the canvas is the size of my palm and resembles a square shape, it does not correspond with the more slender piece of canvas shown in the image of the recipe, which is cut deeply in the middle and split into two longer strips so that they can be wrapped around a mortar.

   <br/>
   <span style="font-size: 120%;">
    I read Marianne Nuij's annotation on eau de vie (from the University of Amsterdam, Spring 2015) and it's really helpful. It points out that author-practitioner distinguishes different kinds of eau de vie, such as "the best eau de vie" and ordinary eau de vie. She suggests that the better eau de vie refers to the one that has gone through several distillations and has higher alcohol content. In my case, the author-practitioner uses an ordinary eau de vie. I notice that Marianne used cognac, a kind of brandy with about 40% alcohol content, for her experiment. I didn't find cognac in our inventory. Instead, I found Rodell Napolean brandy in our inventory, which also has around 40% alcohol content according to its product description on the internet. Moreover, it's a brandy distilled from wine but not fruit brandy. That's why chose it for my reconstruction.

    Subject: Smearing the canvas strips with turpentine
   </strong>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Material:
   <br/>
   Turpentine (Georgia Pine, Diamond G Forest Products; CAS no.: 8006-64-2, appears to be the same as 9005-90-7) - 50 ml
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tools:
   <br/>
   1 measuring beaker
   <br/>
   1 ceramic plate
   <br/>
   1 oil brush with wooden handle
   <br/>
   PPE: Lab coat, face shield, fire-retardant gloves
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Workflow:
   <br/>
   - Put on PPE (lab coat, face shield, fire-retardant gloves and apron)
   <br/>
   - Measure 50 ml of turpentine with a beaker
   <br/>
   - Turpentine reacts with plastic. It is necessary to make sure that turpentine does not get in touch with plastic during the experiment
   <br/>
   - Smear the four completely dried vinegar-brandy soaked canvas strips with turpentine by using a wooden-handled brush under the fume hood
   <br/>
   - Leave the four canvas strips on a clean ceramic plate for drying under the fume hood; put on appropriate label
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Observations:
   <br/>
   The canvas strips look hard after soaking in the vinegar-brandy mixture and drying in the fume hood for two days. They still look curled after being coated with a thin layer of turpentine.

   <span style="font-size: 120%;">
    In the burning experiment, I ended up using three strips of plain canvas and three strips of vinegar-brandy-soaked and turpentine-smeared canvas (hereafter referred to as “VBT canvas”), all of which are ½ inch in width and 2 inches in length, to compare how the two kinds of canvas would perform after being lit by fire. Four days prior to the experiment, I soaked the three canvas strips in a mixture of 50 ml Rodell Napoleon brandy and 100 ml red wine vinegar that is of about 5% acetic acid. After leaving the canvas strips drying for two days, I coated the strips with turpentine, which is made from the distillation of resin from Georgia pine trees. Then I left the turpentine-smeared canvas strips to dry for another two days before conducting the burning tests.The results of the burning experiment and my observations are listed as follows:

    I had to go through four trials because it is much more difficult than one would expect to simply keep a small piece of canvas burning under the air flow of the fume hood. The windiness of the environment would make the canvas extinguish itself very quickly. One may need to put the canvas back into the source of fire for multiple times so as to sustain the burning process. It would also help if one holds the canvas strip steadily and horizontally instead of vertically.
   </span>
   <br/>
   <span style="font-size: 120%;">
    I tried to reduce the variables of the experiment to a minimum in Trial 4, where I held the canvas strips horizontally and did not put the strips back into the source of fire again after lighting them. The VBT canvas performed better than the plain canvas in terms of sustaining the burning process. For the plain canvas, I had to keep the strip in the source of fire for the first 48 seconds to make sure that it burnt stably and properly. After being removed from the source of fire, however, the plain canvas strip only kept burning for 16 more seconds before extinguishing itself and leaving two-third of itself unburned. For the VBT canvas, I removed the strip from the source of fire after 23 seconds and the strip kept burning for 38 more seconds. Only one-fourth of the strip was left unburned at the end of the trial.

    Upon the suggestions of Tianna and Naomi, I changed my workflow and conducted two experiments to compare how the two types of canvas perform against water. The VBT canvas strips I used in the water resistance tests were treated with Rodell Napoleon Brandy, red wine vinegar and Georgia pine turpentine in the same way as those used in the burning tests. In the first experiment (the “drop test”), I put one drop of water on a plain canvas strip as well as on a VBT canvas strip. Then, I observed whether the surface of the two types of canvas absorb water differently. After that, I turned the two strips over and looked at the back of the canvas so as to examine the level of water penetration. In the second experiment (the “dip test”), I first weighed the two kinds of canvas strips, which are both around ½ inch in width and 1 inch in length. Then, I dipped the whole piece of both kinds of canvas into water at the same time and took them out after about 2 seconds. I weighed them again while they were wet to estimate how much water they had absorbed. After leaving them to dry for 15 minutes, I weighed them again. The results of the two experiments and my observations are listed as follows:

    Contrary to my expectation, the plain canvas performed considerably better than the VBT canvas in the “drop test” in terms of its ability to hold up against a small quantity of water penetration. The plain canvas absorbed the drop of water noticeably more slowly than the VBT canvas, and the absorbed water concentrated on a smaller spot on the surface of the plain canvas. In contrast, the VBT canvas absorbed the drop of water very quickly, and the absorbed water spread out on the canvas surface. However, the VBT canvas dried much more quickly than the plain canvas.
   </span>
   <br/>
   <span style="font-size: 110%;">
    In the “dip test,” the VBT canvas absorbed more water than the plain canvas, which is shown by the fact that it gained more weight than the plain canvas after being dipped in the water. The VBT canvas appeared to have lost more weight than the plain canvas after drying for 15 minutes. However, when we calculate in terms of percentage, the VBT canvas only lost 43% of the weight it had gained after dipping, as compared to 58% for the plain canvas, which means that the VBT canvas actually did not dry faster than the plain canvas when it had to deal with a larger quantity of water.
