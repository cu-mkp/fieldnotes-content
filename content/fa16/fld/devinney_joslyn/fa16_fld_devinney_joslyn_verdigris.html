   Setting up my verdigris growing experiment
   <br/>
   <ul>
    <li>
     First, I looked up verdigris recipes in Mary P. Merrifield's
     <em>
      Original Treatises Dating from the XIIth to XVIIIth Centuries on the Arts of Painting
     </em>
     (London: John Murray, 1849) using the links provided on the assignment direction document
    </li>
    <li>
     I decided to try Merrifield's recipe on pg. 118:
    </li>
   </ul>

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <ul>
    <li>
     <strong>
      Materials and Ingredients:
     </strong>
     <ul>
      <li>
       "new jar"--used the jar given to me in class. Does the recipe ask for a "new" jar for cleanliness or some other reason? There is no indication of jar size.
      </li>
      <li>
       "strongest or most acidic vinegar"-- In class, Professor Smith had mentioned that apple cider vinegar with "the mother" was a fine choice for vinegar because it is high in acetic acid, so I used
       <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://bragg.com/products/bragg-organic-apple-cider-vinegar.html" rel="nofollow">
        Bragg
       </a>
       Organic Raw Unfiltered Apple Cider Vinegar.
      </li>
      <li>
       "strips of very clean copper or brass"-- I used the copper I was given in class, and cut it into strips (this was probably not necessary since the piece I was given was not very large to begin with). I washed my hands and tried not to touch the copper to keep it as clean as possible.
      </li>
      <li>
       "a stick"--I used the twine I was given since its purpose is to suspend the copper
      </li>
      <li>
       lid--for sealing the jar
      </li>
     </ul>
    </li>
   </ul>
   <br/>

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <ul>
    <li>
     <strong>
      Method:
     </strong>
     <ul>
      <li>
       "so as not to fill it"-- the only indication of how much vinegar to use; I filled the jar halfway so that it would not touch the copper strips and hung the copper strips so that they did not touch each other, as indicated by the recipe
      </li>
      <li>
       "suspended to a stick"--I put holes in my copper and pushed the twine through the strips; would the author of this recipe have stuck the strips "to" a stick somehow? Does it matter that I pierced the copper?
      </li>
      <li>
       "cover the vase and seal it"--I taped the twine to the sides of the jar, and screwed the lid on tightly to seal it. How would a jar/vase have been sealed in the nineteenth century? Placing the jar in dung would presumably also keep more air out as well as warming the contents.
      </li>
      <li>
       "put it into a warm place, or in dung, or under ground, and leave it for six months"--I did not want to deal with dung or digging under ground so I put the jar on a windowsill (and hoped for sun to warm it). The recipe from the Mappae Clavicula and others on this
       <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.vastrepast.net/www.vastrepast.net/From_Dirt_to_Shirt/Entries/2010/5/31_Making_Verdigris.html" rel="nofollow">
        blog
       </a>
       said to leave the copper for 14 days, so I was hopeful I would get results with the over two weeks we had for our experiment.
      </li>
      <li>
       Theophilus's recipe on the above-mentioned blog calls for moistening the copper with vinegar. Since the recipe I followed says not to let the vinegar touch the copper sheets, I didn't do this. But then my boyfriend knocked into the jar during the second week on the sill and the copper dipped into the vinegar a bit. Darker crystals appeared on the parts of the copper that touched the vinegar. Perhaps the recipes that call for the copper to be moistened with vinegar result in a darker verdigris.
      </li>
      <li>
       After 19 days, I removed the copper and twine from the jar and put them into a plastic Ziploc bag to take to class
      </li>
     </ul>
    </li>
   </ul>
   <br/>
   <img alt="20160310_DeVinney_Verdigris_003.jpg" src="files/20160310_DeVinney_Verdigris_003.jpg" style="height: 224px; width: 296px;" title="20160310_DeVinney_Verdigris_003.jpg"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Despite getting slightly wet with vinegar (and despite the weather not being terribly sunny), the copper turned a strong green color. When I opened the jar, the vinegar was much more pungent than when I first poured it in.

     When I first arrived in class, I removed my copper strips from the bag and placed them on a ceramic plate to dry out. The recipe says to scrape off and set in the sun but, given the time constraints of class, I did not place the powder in the sun once I scrapped it from the strips.

     and determined the main danger was from inhalation of the copper.

       squeezed two droplets of linseed oil with a plastic pipet onto my verdigris powder
      </li>
      <li>
       mixed the oil and powder with the pallet knife and ground the mixture (in a figure eight motion as instructed by Professor Smith) with the glass muller
      </li>
      <li>
       <span style="line-height: 1.5;">
        after almost ten minutes of grinding and scrapping with the muller and pallet knife, the verdigris remained very grainy. Professor Smith encouraged me to press harder with the muller and helped me grind for a few minutes.

      <li>
       I repeated steps taken in photos 4-12 with walnut oil (result: photo 13, square 2e); it's difficult to see much difference between the verdigris with walnut oil and that with linseed oil; if anything, the linseed seems to have made a slightly thicker liquid (but this could be due to a any differences in my mixing technique or quantities of the verdigris used since I did not measure the powder for each trial).
