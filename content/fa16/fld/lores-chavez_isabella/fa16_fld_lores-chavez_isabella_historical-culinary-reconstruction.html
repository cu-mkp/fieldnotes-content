   <ul>
    <li>
     Paring is equivalent to peeling!
    </li>
    <li>
     At 2:03 pm, we put the makeshift pipkin with the apples and water on the stovetop.
    </li>
    <li>
     We stacked two stove grates together (we're calling it a fire tower) to deal with the open flame issue (the glazed stoneware is not supposed to be exposed to an open flame, but we also heated in the oven beforehand, for 30 minutes with the oven heated to 300 degrees).
    </li>
    <li>
     Once the pot was on the fire tower, we felt around the pot to see if it was actually being heated. Indeed, heat from the small stovetop flame could be felt on all sides of the pot. We decided to keep the low flame for this portion of the process.
    </li>
   </ul>
