    “Take all sorts of pleasant flowers, as violets, Cowslips, Roses, Gilly-flowers, Mary-golds, or any other pleasant flowers, and beat them in a mortar every flower by it self, with sugar, untill the sugar be turned to the Colour of the flowers, then put a little gum-dragon to the beating thereof and so beat it out into a perfect paste, and when you have made six pieces of paste of several colours with them, every flower will taste of his nature, then rowl your paste thin, and lay every piece of paste one upon another in mingling sort; then roule your paste into a small rowle as bigge as your finger, then cut it into little pieces overthwart, as big as small nuts, then rowle them thin, that you may see through them; dry them before the fire, and when they be drye, you may box them, and keep them all the year.”

         A search for “gum dragon” in EEBO between 1648 and 1668 shows many contemporary recipes, in which it was steeped, dissolved, or boiled in water, rose water, or vinegar.

        How? Dry? Mixed with liquid? With liquid added after?

        Roll out each paste separately as thin as possible without breakage and then layer them on top of one another so they may be, in turn, rolled up together.
       </span>
      </li>
      <li>
       <span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 16px; vertical-align: baseline;">
        What does “mingling sort” mean? Presumable some kind of overlap. This is where marbling begins, but it is difficult to know exactly what effect de Mayerne is looking for and how to achieve it.
       </span>
      </li>
      <li>
       <span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 16px; vertical-align: baseline;">
        Different meanings of “roll” reflected in de Mayerne’s spelling: “rowl” for rolling out flat with a rolling pin vs. “roule” for rolling all the thin paste disks into a log.
       </span>
      </li>
     </ul>

      <li>
       <span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 16px; vertical-align: baseline;">
        Roll the different colors of paste together like you would a swiss roll or a spiral ice-box cookie dough.
       </span>
      </li>
      <li>
       <span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 16px; vertical-align: baseline;">
        Here is an indication of the amount of ingredients we should be using. That all six layers end up in a roll as big as a finger (though whose finger is another question) indicates that the amount of flowers and sugar shouldn’t be that large (i.e. - a pound of sugar and bouquet of flowers, even if rolled very thin, would make way too much.

      “Cut it into little pieces overthwart, as big as small nuts.”
     </span>
     <ul>
      <li>
       <span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 16px; vertical-align: baseline;">
        Cut the log into smaller pieces width-wise along the length of the log. Again like cutting off ice-box cookies from a log of dough.
       </span>
      </li>
      <li>
       <span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 16px; vertical-align: baseline;">
        “Overthwart” - OED: placed or lying crosswise or across something else; transverse. What kind of nuts? Further research into what kind of nuts were commonly available to de Mayerne (or his audience) might be necessary for an accurate indication of size.

        Should the sugar be cooked so that it becomes hard and shiny or simply dried out so that it is still matte but hard and inflexible? Recipe 132 (for casting sugar) in the same book specifies “sugar being boiled to a candy heigh,” which indicates that the shiny, hard effect one gets when cooking sugar is described as candy, and that by “drying” de Mayerne meant something different.

     <span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 16px; vertical-align: baseline;">
      12:32 We skip the layering and rolling again. The mixture is too sticky even to get it off the paper. The consistency will be tricky.

    </li>
    <li>
     <span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 16px; vertical-align: baseline;">
      Notes: With this consistency it is hard to imagine completing steps 3 to 6 successfully. It would be impossible to get the mixtures off of the board, on to each other, and then rolled again. It is too sticky.
     </span>
    </li>
    <li>
     <span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 16px; vertical-align: baseline;">
      Taste test: Tastes lovely. Sweet and definitely like roses.

    </li>
    <li>
     <span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 16px; vertical-align: baseline;">
      Texture test: undried paste is quite moist, when squeezed a tiny bit sticks to your fingers. When you chew on it you can still feel a trace of the granules of sugar on your tongue. Perhaps we could beat it more next time to make the granules disappear - will that have an effect on rolling?

      12:47 Timer buzzes. Looks duller than before. Compared to the remnants left uncooked it is less sticky. Peels away from the parchment in one solid motion when the parchment is bent backwards. It is hard and no longer sticky on the edges, but there are some parts still sticking to the paper. Air pockets have formed, possibly why it was expanding. Bottom parts of the air pockets are stuck to the paper. Reminiscent of making macaron. Translucent. The broken pieces of rose petals look like uneven mineral

     <span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 16px; vertical-align: baseline;">
      12:55 In the meantime, the little bit of the paste on the other parchment dried. Can taste the granules. The pieces are still too delicate.
     </span>
    </li>
    <li>
     <span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 16px; vertical-align: baseline;">
      12:58 Harder, but still some parts stuck to the parchment. Top is duller. Some sugar crystals have melted. Smells more fragrant when hot. The top layer has dried, whereas the bottom layer (in contact with the parchment) has melted. Bottom layer feels sticky (felt through the parchment). Top is hard. Little bit crisper than last time. A little chewier. The flavor is still strong and will withstand longer exposure to heat. Broke a piece off from another part: a little more snap, and crunchier. We are still wondering whether we are expecting something like brandy snaps or fruit leather.

    </li>
    <li>
     <span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 16px; vertical-align: baseline;">
      1:05 We realize that the paste continued to dry even after heating. Some air pockets, broken flower petals look like minerals.

    Method: Since we had access to more flowers for this trial, we attempted the full recipe. Steps 1 and two were completed for each flower, and the resulting balls of “perfect paste” were stored in a glass bowl under a damp towel to keep them from drying out until we reached step 3. Mortar and pestle were cleaned with soap and warm water between each flower. Also note, we forgot to keep track of the time on this trial.

        This time, we made a mixture of 1tbs dragon and 2 tbs water in a small glass bowl. This resulted in a gummy paste that formed small clumps when stirred.

      <li>
       <span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 16px; vertical-align: baseline;">
        ¼ tsp of the tragacanth/water mixture added to the sugar/flower mixture. Tragacanth runs smoothly but doesn’t quite mix in with the sugar easily - immediate reaction is to add more water. We don’t. Tragacanth is slowly being incorporated into the sugar but it is not homogenous, still clumps of tragacanth jelly. Like bloomed gelatin not incorporated at the right temperature. attempts to grind more to break up little clumps of gum. Not forming a dough. Not clumping as well as yesterday. Color is more homogenous than yesterday. Little bit smoother than yesterday but little clumps of gum are still visible.

      <li>
       <span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 16px; vertical-align: baseline;">
        ⅛ tsp dry tragacanth added. The mixture is more difficult to maneuver. The sugar is adhering more to the sides than before. A paste is forming more quickly. More like a paste, but there are still little granules of sugar falling off.

      </li>
      <li>
       <span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 16px; vertical-align: baseline;">

      <li>
       <span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 16px; vertical-align: baseline;">
        1/8 tsp water added. The mixture is adhering but quite sticky. Not uniform: the water has not been incorporated homogeneously throughout the mixture. Mixture is “beaten” for longer. Becomes thicker in consistency and more homogenous as the water is beaten in. Forms clumps that adhere to each other.

        From the experience with blue sage, we decided that the pre-mixed dragon-water mixture was not effective. Instead, we added the tragacanth and water separately in the same ratio (since that ratio did result in a gummy consistency when it was just dragon and water)
       </span>
      </li>
      <li>
       <span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 16px; vertical-align: baseline;">
        3/8 tsp dry tragacanth added. Very quickly indistinguishable from the sugar. More grainy and less crystaline. Nothing is adhering quite yet. Now we are getting clumps of sugar sticking togetheer. The whole mixture is sticking to the side of the mortar more consistenty. We will def need more water.
       </span>
      </li>
      <li>
       <span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 16px; vertical-align: baseline;">
        ⅛ tsp water added. More jelly like where the water hits. Not immediately incorporated homogeneously. Bits stick to the side and others stick to the pestle. Definitely cohering more. Have to scrape some off the pestle to incorporate the mixture better. The trick is getting it fast enough so that the mixture does not form clumps. Still, this is a better mixture than the blue sage/salvia.

        Colors come through nicely when the slices were laid on their sides. Layers do appear sort of spirally but resemble marble remarkably. de Mayerne was probably able to roll them thinner than we can.

       <span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 16px; vertical-align: baseline;">

      <li>
       <span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 16px; vertical-align: baseline;">
        The different pieces cohere quite well when rolled out - the different pieces stick together. Looks more like granite than marble though.

      <li>
       <span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 16px; vertical-align: baseline;">
        The paste continued to dry while exposed to air. Even the cut pieces are more resistant to the rolling pin.

    Note: We used the same procedure for the second batch as well, with nearly identical results.Second batch, however, (halves of the gum-sugar-flower mix) dried while exposed to air. Had to be sprayed with an atomizer for moisture in order for us to roll them out. Also, we spritzed the second roll before we rolled it up so the pieces would adhere. This worked well, as there was little breakage during the second second rolling.

        Only in the 1659 edition does a similar recipe appear: “To make Paste of flowers of the colour of Marble, tasting of natural flowers. / Take every sort of pleasing flowers, as Violets, Cowslips, Gilly-flowers, Roses or Marigolds, and beat them in a Mortar, each flower by it self with sugar, till the sugar become the colour of the flower, then put a little Gum Dragon steept in water into it, and beat it into a perfect paste; and when you have half a dozen colours, every flower will take of his nature, then rowl the paste therein, and lay one piece upon another, in mingling sort, so rowl your Paste in small rowls, as big and as long as your finger, then cut it off the bigness of a small nut, overthwart, and so rowl them thin, that you may see a knife through them, so dry them before the fire till they be dry.” Note that gum dragon is steeped in water in this version. Perhaps do a side-by-side comparison with the original recipe?

        After the opening epistle, the section “The Prescribers and Approvers of most of these rare Receipts, their following names are in several Pages of this Book inserted and annexed to their own experienced Receipts” includes “Dr. Mayhern [sic], Physician to the late King” and refers to a recipe on p. 180. This is not the paste recipe, but “A Purge by Dr. Mayhern.”

        483: “Theodore de Mayerne, physician to James and Anne and, later, to Henrietta Maria—to whom he was especially close—is credited only with a ‘A Purge by Dr. Mayhern.’ But a number of the culinary recipes in ‘The Compleat Cook’ are close to, or even duplicate, those in Mayerne’s later Archimagirus.” [CK: Note that Knopper seems to have analyzed only the earlier editions—see below.]

        483n71: “Recipes in ‘The Compleat Cook’—the third part of The Queens Closet Opened (1656 edition)—that appear in identical or nearly identical form in Mayerne’s Archimagirus (1659) include ‘To make a Pudding of a Calves Chaldron,’ ‘To make Chickens fat in four or five dayes,’ ‘To make a Bisque of Carps,’ ‘To boyle Ducks after the French fashion,’ ‘To dresse a Fillet of Veale the Italian way,’ ‘ To boyle a rump of Beefe after the French fashion,’ ‘To boyle Cream with French Barly,’ ‘To make a Steake Pye with a French Pudding in the Pye,’ and ‘To make the best Sausages that ever was eat.’ Other recipes—for example, ‘To boyle a Capon larded with Lemons’—appear in expanded form in Mayerne, perhaps indicating that the two printed collections shared a common source, or that Mayerne was the prior source for the queen’s recipe.”

        490: “In November 1659, John Beale wrote to Samuel Hartlib that, ‘Our Stationers shops have lately swarmed with bookes of Cookery, Some in our Late Queenes name, Some from the Countese of Kent, as if Selden had imployd his Antiquityes in her Kitchin, &amp; lately the Famous Sir Theodore Mayerne is at the Middle Temple gate under the name of Archemagirus Anglo-gallicus.’
