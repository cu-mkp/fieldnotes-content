2. Recipe: <strong>p120v_5</strong><br />
&lt;head&gt;Keeping dried flowers in good condition year round&lt;/head&gt;&lt;ab&gt;<br />
&lt;m&gt;River sand&lt;/m&gt;, that is washed by the current of water, is good when strained in a cloth to make the powder compact.&lt;/ab&gt;<br />
&lt;ab&gt;This is a rare secret, and which is pleasing for decorating tables, rooms, <strong>studies</strong> out of season when winter denies you flowers. Be advised to pick them when they are in full vigor and still growing, because if you take them when no longer in bloom or when they are starting to wilt, they will not keep. Having therefore chosen them, take some &lt;m&gt;sand&lt;/m&gt;, the leanest and driest you can find, that must be very well ground, like the one &lt;pro&gt;goldsmiths&lt;/pro&gt; use to sand &lt;m&gt;enamel&lt;/m&gt;, or like the one [used] for engraving. But this &lt;m&gt;sand&lt;/m&gt; must not be dusty at all, nor must it stay on your hand or leave a trace when you have ground or poured it, because it is[f]<br />
Make sure your box is well sealed so that the &lt;m&gt;sand&lt;/m&gt; does not get out. Keep it uncovered in sunlight and keep it away from the evening dew, and the moisture of the night, and cover it and keep it in a dry place.<br />
You can not put these aforementioned flowers in big vases, because if you want to take one out, you will take the whole bunch with it.<br />
Be advised to not pick your flowers when it is rainy or humid, but when the sun has been shining on them.<br />
Flowers can also be kept just as beautifully in &lt;m&gt;vinegar&lt;/m&gt;, distilled in a vase, well-sealed so it there is no draft, well-sealed with &lt;m&gt;wax&lt;/m&gt; and &lt;m&gt;mastic&lt;/m&gt;. [For] carnations and roses, the residue of &lt;m&gt;vinegar&lt;/m&gt; usually makes them rot. If the &lt;m&gt;sand&lt;/m&gt; is dusty, and sticks to the flowers so that it hardly comes off with a brush, it is no good. The leannest &lt;m&gt;sand&lt;/m&gt; is the best.&lt;/ab&gt;<br />
&lt;cont/&gt; <strong>p0120v_4</strong><br />
a sign that there is some humidity and if the flower was also watery it would rot. Moreover the sand must not be &lt;del/&gt; rough because its weight would make the flower lose its original shape. Once you have chosen it accordingly, take a &lt;tl&gt;box&lt;/tl&gt; in which you first make a layer of sand on which you will display the stalk of the flower laid in a way that the flower does not touch nor the bottom nor the edges of the &lt;tl&gt;box&lt;/tl&gt; and stands in the air. Then add more &lt;del/&gt; sand on the stalk so that it remains strong and solid. Finally take some of the same sand and sprinkle and subtly display it with two &lt;tl&gt;&lt;bp&gt;fingers&lt;/bp&gt;&lt;/tl&gt; on the flower like the flow of an &lt;ms&gt; &lt;tl&gt;hourglass&lt;/tl&gt;&lt;/ms&gt;. And once the flower is &lt;del/&gt; covered, strike with your &lt;bp&gt;&lt;tl&gt;fist&lt;/tl&gt;&lt;/bp&gt; the table on which the &lt;tl&gt;box&lt;/tl&gt; is displayed, so that the sand lowers and surrounds everything. Finally cover the entire flower, and lay other flowers, one after the other, as many as the &lt;tl&gt;box&lt;/tl&gt; can hold. Then put the &lt;tl&gt;box&lt;/tl&gt; in &lt;tmp&gt;warm sun&lt;/tmp&gt; for &lt;ms&gt;&lt;tmp&gt;several days&lt;/tmp&gt;&lt;/ms&gt;. And as the flower dries, the sand that goes with it continues to press and prevents it from rotting and tightening and consequently, it dries and keeps its original shape. And to do so, make sure to chose boufarcis, &lt;pa&gt;marigold&lt;/pa&gt;s, the &lt;pa&gt;yellow meadow's flowers&lt;/pa&gt; called &lt;la&gt;&lt;pa&gt;rammenlus&lt;/pa&gt;&lt;/la&gt; or &lt;la&gt;&lt;pa&gt;palta lupina&lt;/pa&gt;&lt;/la&gt;, &lt;pa&gt;amaranth&lt;/pa&gt;, and similar flowers like &lt;pa&gt;broom&lt;/pa&gt; and others which you will know from experience.<br />
The sand the &lt;pro&gt;goldsmith&lt;/pro&gt;s use to sand &lt;m&gt;enamel&lt;/m&gt;s and the white one which the &lt;pro&gt;glassworker&lt;/pro&gt;s use and any type of fine sand which does not have much body, put it through a &lt;tl&gt;sieve&lt;/tl&gt; made of &lt;m&gt;horsehair&lt;/m&gt; because this matter must not be very thin. Then dry it well in the &lt;env&gt;sun&lt;/env&gt; for &lt;ms&gt; &lt;tmp&gt;several days&lt;/tmp&gt;&lt;/ms&gt; in order to remove the dampness and ventilate it as you would do with &lt;m&gt;wheat&lt;/m&gt; so that the dust goes away. Once cleaned of dust and dried, use it as you know.<br />
&lt;pa&gt;Pansies&lt;/pa&gt; can be preserved in the same way.&lt;/ab&gt; &lt;/div&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
3. Plan:<br />
<ul><li>Historical: We will research the history of the study of flowers in herbals and other herbaria in Early Modern France. This recipe is stated to specifically be for decorating as well as for the study of flowers year-round-- Why might it have been better to dry the flowers for examination rather than press them into the book (3D effect?)? Which was more common? What type of information did they get from these studies? Were these flowers models for other artificial casts of flowers? Were these flowers the ones which were put under glass cases? In what context would one want flowers for both decoration and study? This type of flower drying is still in use, and has been documented at different points throughout the centuries: The New England Farmer, Volume 10 by Thomas Greene Fessenden (1832); <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.finegardening.com/drying-flowers-sand" rel="nofollow">http://www.finegardening.com/drying-flowers-sand</a></li><li>Object Based: It might be hard to find such preserved flowers in museum objects, but it might be possible to find them in paintings. Perhaps we can contact Alix Cooper to talk with her about her research as well. There are certainly a number of herbals and herbaria that we would be able to take a look at as well.</li><li>Hands-on: We will dry flowers using the recipe (there are two experiments included in the recipe)</li></ul><br />
<br />
4. Materials:<br />
<ul><li>Box -- what type of box would have been used? Probably wooden, which can be purchased from a craft store</li><li>Sand-- fine grain sand, like the kinds available from craft stores-- I am not sure how we would strain it using something approximating horse hair: &quot;Having therefore chosen them, take some &lt;m&gt;sand&lt;/m&gt;, the leanest and driest you can find, that must be very well ground, like the one &lt;pro&gt;goldsmiths&lt;/pro&gt; use to sand &lt;m&gt;enamel&lt;/m&gt;, or like the one [used] for engraving. But this &lt;m&gt;sand&lt;/m&gt; must not be dusty at all, nor must it stay on your hand or leave a trace when you have ground or poured it, because it is The sand the &lt;pro&gt;goldsmith&lt;/pro&gt;s use to sand &lt;m&gt;enamel&lt;/m&gt;s and the white one which the &lt;pro&gt;glassworker&lt;/pro&gt;s use and any type of fine sand which does not have much body, put it through a &lt;tl&gt;sieve&lt;/tl&gt; made of &lt;m&gt;horsehair&lt;/m&gt; because this matter must not be very thin.<br />
&lt;m&gt;River sand&lt;/m&gt;, that is washed by the current of water, is good when strained in a cloth to make the powder compact.&lt;/ab&gt;<br />
If the &lt;m&gt;sand&lt;/m&gt; is dusty, and sticks to the flowers so that it hardly comes off with a brush, it is no good. The leannest &lt;m&gt;sand&lt;/m&gt; is the best.&lt;/ab&gt;&quot;</li><li>Flowers-- Pansies, marigold, lupines, etc. are mentioned specifically in the text. There are a number of flower shops/nurseries that would sell such flowers<br />
<br />
---- if we decide to do both experiments included in the recipe:</li><li>Vinegar-- Should be organic and “of the mother”, but it is not specified what type of vinegar is needed (much like our verdigris experiments)</li><li>Flowers can also be kept just as beautifully in &lt;m&gt;vinegar&lt;/m&gt;, distilled in a vase, well-sealed so it there is no draft, well-sealed with &lt;m&gt;wax&lt;/m&gt; and &lt;m&gt;mastic&lt;/m&gt;.</li><li>Wax-- can be bought from a craft store; we would need to do some research on types of wax available in 16th century France</li><li>Mastin-- a type of plant resin ; should be available in plant shops, but we would need to do some research to see if it is the same type used in the past (would this matter since it is just a part of the seal??)</li><li>Vase -- made of glass, can be bought in a craft store, flower store, etc.</li></ul><br />

<ol><li>Box — I have identified several wooden boxes that can be purchased cheaply and are sealed on the edges to hold the sand in — the box does not need a top — because the focus is on the sand and the flower within the box, I’m not sure the type of wood used to make the box was of concern to the a-p</li><li><span class="s1">Sand— The word for sand in the recipe is “sable”; the sand should not be too powdery, too wet, or too thin, and should be “lean”— the a-p mentions that it should not “stay on your hand” which actually gives a good idea as to how fine the sand should be</span></li><li><span class="s1">Flowers-- Pansies, marigold, lupines, etc. are mentioned specifically in the text — most of these flowers are out of season, but there are still a number of organic flowers available in the Union Square market that could be used— the a-p specifically warns against roses and carnations in the vinegar experiment, so I will try to avoid using those in either experiement.

<br />
<br />
<span class="s1"><strong>Procedure</strong></span><br />
<span class="s1">EXPERIMENT 1:</span><br />
<ol><li><span class="s1">Having therefore chosen them [flowers], take some &lt;m&gt;sand&lt;/m&gt;, the leanest and driest you can find, that must be very well ground, like the one &lt;pro&gt;goldsmiths&lt;/pro&gt; use to sand &lt;m&gt;enamel&lt;/m&gt;, or like the one [used] for engraving. But this &lt;m&gt;sand&lt;/m&gt; must not be dusty at all, nor must it stay on your hand or leave a trace when you have ground or poured it, because it is[f] a sign that there is some humidity and if the flower was also watery it would rot. Moreover the sand must not be &lt;del/&gt; rough because its weight would make the flower lose its original shape. Once you have chosen it accordingly, take a &lt;tl&gt;box&lt;/tl&gt; in which you first make a layer of sand on which you will display the stalk of the flower laid in a way that the flower does not touch nor the bottom nor the edges of the &lt;tl&gt;box&lt;/tl&gt; and stands in the air.<br />
— The flowers should be laid out in a box, with a layer of sand on the bottom so that the flower does not touch the bottom at all— it seems the flower should be standing in the box (should it be standing with the stem in the sand or the flower itself provides the base?- based on the next step, it should be the stalk)</span></li><li><span class="s1">Then add more &lt;del/&gt; sand on the stalk so that it remains strong and solid.<br />
— adding more sand around the base so that the flower does not fall over</span></li><li><span class="s1">Finally take some of the same sand and sprinkle and subtly display it with two &lt;tl&gt;&lt;bp&gt;fingers&lt;/bp&gt;&lt;/tl&gt; on the flower like the flow of an &lt;ms&gt; &lt;tl&gt;hourglass&lt;/tl&gt;&lt;/ms&gt;.<br />
—sprinkle some sand over the flower — presumably to get sand to surround the flower without crushing it</span></li><li><span class="s1">And once the flower is &lt;del/&gt; covered, strike with your &lt;bp&gt;&lt;tl&gt;fist&lt;/tl&gt;&lt;/bp&gt; the table on which the &lt;tl&gt;box&lt;/tl&gt; is displayed, so that the sand lowers and surrounds everything.<br />
— this step is probably to even out the sand in the box</span></li><li><span class="s1">Finally cover the entire flower, and lay other flowers, one after the other, as many as the &lt;tl&gt;box&lt;/tl&gt; can hold. Then put the &lt;tl&gt;box&lt;/tl&gt; in &lt;tmp&gt;warm sun&lt;/tmp&gt; for &lt;ms&gt;&lt;tmp&gt;several days&lt;/tmp&gt;&lt;/ms&gt;. And as the flower dries, the sand that goes with it continues to press and prevents it from rotting and tightening and consequently, it dries and keeps its original shape<br />
— this step indicates adding other flowers to the box, which would be difficult if it was filled with sand already. likely, the author-practitioner would have needed to lay out other flowers next to the first one before filling the box with the rest of the sand</span></li><li><span class="s1">Make sure your box is well sealed so that the &lt;m&gt;sand&lt;/m&gt; does not get out. Keep it uncovered in sunlight and keep it away from the evening dew, and the moisture of the night, and cover it and keep it in a dry place.<br />
— the a-p indicates sealing the box but then says to keep it uncovered— he is likely referring to keeping the bottom and sides sealed to prevent the sand from getting out, but keeping the top open to the sunlight — based on his descriptions of the evening dew, it probably needs to be placed in a warm, dry place, but not necessarily a well-lit one</span></li><li><span class="s1">You can not put these aforementioned flowers in big vases, because if you want to take one out, you will take the whole bunch with it.<br />
— refers to the difficulty of using the flowers for decoration in a home — possibly because the petals get dry and are not easily maneuverable?</span></li></ol><br />
<span class="s1">EXPERIMENT 2:</span><br />
<ol><li><span class="s1">Flowers can also be kept just as beautifully in &lt;m&gt;vinegar&lt;/m&gt;, distilled in a vase, </span><br />
-- placing the flowers in a vase filled with vinegar-- presumably the flowers will float, so I will have to figure out a way to keep it submerged</li><li><span class="s1">well-sealed so it there is no draft, well-sealed with &lt;m&gt;wax&lt;/m&gt; and &lt;m&gt;mastic&lt;/m&gt;.<br />
— the vase the flowers are placed in needs to be sealed well— because I am focusing on the use of vinegar to preserve the flowers, I will probably use plastic wrap or something similar to seal the top of the vase, especially considering the recipe does not say what will be sealing the vase (what would the wax have been sealing on the top to keep it covered? is it a piece of glass, wood, etc.?)<br />
— it wouldn’t dry them out in the same way as the first experiment, so could this second experiment change the look of the flowers? would the flowers preserved in this way be used for something different (i.e. the study of flowers for paintings vs the study of flowers for science?)</span></li></ol><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><span class="s1">Further research plans:</span></strong><br />
<ol><li>Since our last discussion, I made an appointment with the New York Botanical Gardens library which I was unable to keep due to illness-- I will make another appointment in the coming week to look at some of their collection of herbals, herbaria, and possibly woodblocks as well</li><li>In my historical research, I am still interested in examining the place of this type of preservation of flowers in the history of natural science and the writing/drawing of scientific literature in Early Modern France. I have been reading Brian Ogilvie's <em>The Science of Describing</em>, which has been extremely helpful so far, along with Kusukawa's <em>Picturing the Book of Nature</em></li><li>Because I am unsure of whether these preserved flowers were used for natural history study or still-life art study, I will probably also explore some still life paintings of flowers that feature varieties which do not generally bloom at the same time</li><li>This recipe does not describe &quot;preserving&quot; or &quot;drying&quot; specifically in the title-- only &quot;keeping&quot; the flowers; however the second experiment uses vinegar to keep the flowers, which was used in a number of other medicinal recipes in the manuscript, including one about &quot;preserving oneself&quot;:<br />
&lt;id&gt;p170v_a3&lt;/id&gt; &lt;head&gt;To preserve oneself&lt;/head&gt;<br />
&lt;ab&gt;&lt;m&gt;Acetum&lt;/m&gt; paratum ex &lt;m&gt;ruta&lt;/m&gt; &lt;m&gt;baccis juniperi&lt;/m&gt; simul tusis Eo&lt;lb/&gt;&lt;m&gt;aceto&lt;/m&gt; extinguantur &lt;m&gt;lateres&lt;/m&gt; igniti. Et vapor excipiatur ore [&amp;]&lt;lb/&gt;naribus. &lt;m&gt;Rue&lt;/m&gt; &lt;m&gt;vinegar&lt;/m&gt; together with crushed &lt;m&gt;juniper berries&lt;/m&gt;. Pour the &lt;m&gt;vinegar&lt;/m&gt; over red hot &lt;m&gt;bricks&lt;/m&gt; and inhale the vapor through the mouth and nostrils. This is to preserve oneself when going into noxious air: a garment can be perfumed with this vapor in order to remove infection from a room, house, etc. And if you find yourself in a place where you do not have this preparation, carry &lt;m&gt;rue&lt;/m&gt; and &lt;m&gt;berries&lt;/m&gt;[e] crushed together, then, if need be, boil them in &lt;m&gt;vinegar&lt;/m&gt; and use as described.&lt;/ab&gt;<br />
What are the implications of the word &quot;keep&quot; vs. preserving or drying?</li><li>I also have a number of books on the historical distribution of plant species in Europe, especially since the cultural meaning of flowers likely changed as new types of flowers travelled between European and Asian lands -- because the author-practitioner mentions specifically using these preserved/dried flowers as decoration, it would be beneficial to understand such cultural meanings, of which Elizabeth Hyde's <em>Cultivated Power</em> has considered</li></ol><br />

I have now collected my flowers and beach sand and also made my wooden boxes. Over the break I also continued my research into how vinegar is made (so as to determine the acetic acid concentration needed in the experiment), the cultural meanings of flowers in France, how flowers were used in decoration in Early Modern France, and worked on gathering more information about the flowers mentioned in the MS from the herbals I looked at in the New York Botanical Garden library on Tuesday. Most of the herbals were French translations of other books, but there were a few herbals which were helpful in learning about the properties/names/locations/etc. of the plants from the recipe, including Matthioli and Dodoens (mentioned in the Ms). The librarian at the archive was also unsure of 'boufarcis' in the list of flowers, and this is the only flower which I have not been able to find information on (including searching variations in spelling). I spoke with Vanessa Sellers at the library as well, and may try to contact her to see if she has any ideas.<br />
I have also continued to look at the context of the recipe/materials in the manuscript: how flowers/sand/vinegar are used in other recipes, other types of preservation, and if there are any other recipes where the purpose of the created objects, etc. was for ornamental use. After my experiments are completed, I would like to see if the flowers still hold their smell and how vibrant their color is in addition to seeing if they actually hold their form-- I have found a book on the history of the senses (on request at the library) that I hope will have some relevant information on smell and color during the Early Modern period; considering smell was important in medicine as well as the information I have found on the use of dried flowers to provide a type of perfume (potpourri) later on in the seventeenth century, I would be interested to see if the flowers could have played a role in creating a sweeter or more pleasant smell in homes even after they were dried. I am also interested in seeing how well they hold their color, and how closely they resemble the live flowers<br />

In books of the time, the acid concentration is not mentioned when describing this process (that I have yet found), but vinegar makers who still use this method have reported 7% acetic acid concentration in their resulting product. I chose 50% as my second number based on references to distilled vinegar elsewhere in the manuscript which describe it as being used to carve into materials (amber, wood, etc.); I thought that it should be a fairly high concentration if it was being used to carve, but that it should not be too high as to 'eat away' at the plants themselves, which are an organic material</li></ul><br />

<br />

<ul><li>ELP mused that pouring sand is like watching time pass in an hourglass</li><li>CS developed a technique to avoid pouring directly on the flowers that entailed pouring against the wall</li><li>TU noticed that the leaves of the rose for box 1 helped it stand up, as the rose for box 2 has no leaves and struggled to stay upright on its own</li><li>CS noticed that after pounding the table the box was on (as the AP directed) the sand seemed to settle less—perhaps because the grains of sand were much finer<br />

<em>Assembling vinegar jars</em><br />
<ul><li>when placing the flowers into the full jars of vinegar, the flowers seemed to float so we devised a method for keeping them submerged by using a piece of circular parafilm that was larger than the lip of the jar and pushed down to the surface of the vinegar using chopsticks -- because some vinegar got on top of the parafilm which gave it some weight, the flowers underneath stayed submerged -- we had to do this for each of the jars where the flowers had to be fully submerged<br />
<img src="files/20161129_Sellar_flowersinpreservative_190.jpg" alt="20161129_Sellar_flowersinpreservative_190.jpg" title="20161129_Sellar_flowersinpreservative_190.jpg" style="height: 363px; width: 276px;" /> <img src="files/20161129_Sellar_flowersinpreservative_193.jpg" alt="20161129_Sellar_flowersinpreservative_193.jpg" title="20161129_Sellar_flowersinpreservative_193.jpg" style="height: 370px; width: 279px;" /></li><li>20min after placing the delphinium in the acetic acid jars, the color of the petals began to change from purple to pink-- the larkspur in the same jars did not change color ; the &quot;dripping&quot; of the pigment was much more rapid in the 50% acid jar than in the 7% -- we will have to see if the fumes from the vinegar in the jars affects the rest of the petals over time<br />

<em>Materials:</em><br />
<ol><li>scooping implements and brushes (see picture)<br />
<img src="files/2016-12-09%2018.55.19.jpg" alt="2016-12-09 18.55.19.jpg" title="2016-12-09 18.55.19.jpg" style="height: 166px; width: 217px;" /></li><li>gloves</li><li>goggles</li><li>mask</li><li>clay</li><li>plate</li><li>small plastic cups</li><li>jars (3)</li></ol><br />
<em>Procedure + notes:</em><br />
<ul><li>the flowers were kept in the boxes for 10 days -- this was in between the 1 and 2 week mark most modern-day florists advise-- the a-p does not denote a time for how long he wants the flowers kept in the sand, but many florists advise not to keep them in sand for too long because they can get too brittle</li><li>we first considered tipping the boxes and pouring out the sand, because modern-day florists use this method to remove thier flowers; however, because one set of flowers had boxes fashioned around the top parts of their blooms, we decided to simply use &quot;scooping instruments instead.&quot; -- we used a spoon, a small plastic cup, a small plastic bowl, measuring spoons, etc.<br />
<img src="files/2016-12-09%2016.53.26.jpg" alt="2016-12-09 16.53.26.jpg" title="2016-12-09 16.53.26.jpg" style="height: 262px; width: 348px;" /></li><li>we began by using a brush to push away some of the sand and locate where each of the flowers were in box one<br />
<img src="files/2016-12-09%2016.30.33.jpg" alt="2016-12-09 16.30.33.jpg" title="2016-12-09 16.30.33.jpg" style="height: 235px; width: 311px;" /></li><li>once the flowers were located, we began to dig around the flowers with the various implements-- by scooping sand out next to the flower, the sand that immediately surrounded the petals and stem fell away; this seemed like a more gentle method for removing the sand from around the flowers<br />
<img src="files/2016-12-09%2020.12.41.jpg" alt="2016-12-09 20.12.41.jpg" title="2016-12-09 20.12.41.jpg" style="height: 336px; width: 254px;" /></li><li>the first one removed was the larkspur from the beach sand box -- it was remarkably lifelike, and it kept most of its color</li><li>although the flower was slightly wilting when it was put in, the blooms were still well-preserved in the condition they were put into the box; it is possible that the author-practitioner meant for people to pick flowers at their peak because then they would be preserved when they looked best (not necessarily that the preservation works better if the flowers are in full bloom and not wilting)</li><li>the petals on the larkspurs and delphiniums felt like tissue paper-- thin, but bendable and did not break when picked up<br />
<img src="files/2016-12-09%2018.20.52.jpg" alt="2016-12-09 18.20.52.jpg" title="2016-12-09 18.20.52.jpg" style="height: 174px; width: 231px;" /></li><li>the roses were quite brittle, however, and small pieces broke off as these were being uncovered -- they were also the only flower to change color while being preserved, from a bright red to a deep maroon/purple -- the roses also became slightly pinched and darker brown at the point where the stem meets the flower, which was unique to this variety<br />
<img src="files/2016-12-09%2017.20.58.jpg" alt="2016-12-09 17.20.58.jpg" title="2016-12-09 17.20.58.jpg" style="height: 190px; width: 251px;" /></li><li>the delphiniums, although the petals themselves held up well on their own, continued to &quot;flake&quot; as they were uncovered from the sand in all three boxes, likely because they were wilting when placed in the boxes and the point where the petals meet the bud could have been compromised earlier<br />
<img src="files/2016-12-09%2018.29.55.jpg" alt="2016-12-09 18.29.55.jpg" title="2016-12-09 18.29.55.jpg" style="height: 241px; width: 318px;" /></li><li>the larkspur from the fine quartz powder box looked the best-- the petals were bright and more of the petals stayed on this than any other flower that was taken out of the boxes</li><li>the quartz powder also stayed in place the best when uncovering the flowers- this helped to make sure that the weight of the sand did not crush the petals from the top as the bottom fell away<br />
<img src="files/2016-12-09%2019.32.00.jpg" alt="2016-12-09 19.32.00.jpg" title="2016-12-09 19.32.00.jpg" style="height: 446px; width: 593px;" /></li><li>we then placed the larkspur and delphinium flowers into clay &quot;stands&quot; to help them to stay upright, and placed the roses into jars since they were more top-heavy. we also collected the flower petals that had fallen while they were removed from the sand, and placed them into small cups</li></ul><br />
<br />
<em>Questions:</em><br />
<ul><li>why did the roses change color when the delphinium and larkspur did not?</li><li>why does it appear that the salt from the beach sand did not have an effect on the preservation process?</li><li>why did the rose stems become thin at the top, where the stem meets the flower, when this did not happen to the others?</li></ul><br />
<br />
<em>Vinegar trial check-in:</em><br />
<ul><li>there was little change in the flowers since the last check-in, although it seems that the larkspur in the apple cider vinegar is holding up better than some of the others</li><li>it is surprising how well the roses are doing in all of the vinegar-- they were not meant to preserve well using vinegar, but they are doing better than a number of other blooms in the vinegar trials</li><li>it does seem that the vinegar is condensing into droplets on the petals and could be affecting how well they hold up</li><li>Question: why are the roses doing so well?<br />
Question: what will happen when the flowers are taken out of the jars?</li><li>if i were to do this experiment again, I would add a control jar of water to test against the vinegar, and also possible add a time variable as well for when they are taken out ; it is possible to see the changes in the flowers through the jars, but we do not know if there would be any changes once they are taken out<br />
it is also a possibility that he meant for the flowers to be sealed around the stem, and not above the bloom -- the vinegar condensing on the petals could affect the way they are preserved</li></ul><br />

I have chosen to keep--<br />
- 50V full submersion delphinium and larkspur to keep track of how they are dissolving in the distilled vinegar<br />
- 50V full roses, 7V full roses, and ACV full rose to test how they hold up over time; the ACV is not supposed to keep the rose/carnation preserved well, b<br />
- 50V partial rose to observe the color changes in the petals, since this one is much more vibrant that the other vinegars<br />
- ACV partial delphinium and larkspur because the larkspur was the only partial submersion delph/lark that did not 'sag' in the jar, its stem is still fairly straight and the color of the petals is still close to what it originally was (although a little muted)<br />

<em>removing flowers from vinegar jars</em><br />
General observations: the double parafilm + plastic lid seal seems to have been an effective seal—parafilm was cut where the threads were, but the top remained tightly sealed and intact. no mould on any of the flowers.<br />
1. full ACV delp and lark - removed parafilm disk with tweezers; brown film on underside; unclear if brown residue is a result of the vinegar or dissolved, stringy, gooey flowers. The smell of apple cider vinegar was very strong, with an undertone of alcohol or fermentation to the point of slight rottenness<br />

2. partial ACV rose - turned orange; much condensation on the petals;<br />
3. partial 7% rose - when wafting, it smells of rose, slight rot, and; much condensation on the petals;<br />
2 and 3 are similar in color—orange and red tie-dye like. The color is coming off both flowers' petals. The stems are strong. The petals are softer than they were initially, but you have to tug them pretty hard to get them to come off. Decided to keep these two roses and put in the fume hood to dry out of curiosity—perhaps the recipe intended that the roses should be initially treated with vinegar and then dried.<br />

4. partial 50% delph and lark - very strong smell of vinegar/acid; the stems, where they were under the acid, remain strong and turgid; where the stems were outside the acid, they have gone limp; despite the ease with which the petals fell off the flowers before they were processed, now the petals are more difficult to remove. Cleaning out the jar of the 50%, it smells like flowers that have been kept in water for too long and are finally taken out.<br />
5. full 7% delph and lark - comparatively little smell; the flowers themselves smell of rotting stems that have been in a vase too long; the stems are soft and yield beneath the tweezers' pinch; delphinium petals were firmly attached while the larkspur petals came off easily<br />

6. partial 7% delph and lark - smells like rotting flowers; NJR: it smells a bit like artichokes; the stems are soft and yield beneath the tweezers' pinch; delphinium petals were firmly attached; the larkspur petals have changed from purple to brown-green<br />
7. set apart ACV rose and 7V rose on a ceramic plate to dry in the fume hood -- we were curious to see what would happen to the petal color/overall look of the flowers when they were dried after being submerged<br />
