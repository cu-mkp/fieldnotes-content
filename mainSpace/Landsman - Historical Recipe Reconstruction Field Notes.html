350 F, on roster in middle oven<br />

<strong>REWRITTEN RECIPE</strong><br />
<br />
FINE BISCUIT BREAD<br />
<br />
Recipe makes two loaves in 3/4 lb. 4”x8” bread pans.<br />
1 lb. whole wheat stoneground pastry flour, sifted<br />
1 lb. cane sugar, coarsely ground<br />
4 large eggs<br />
2 1/2 tbsp. rosewater<br />
2 tbs lightly salted butter<br />
<br />
Combine flour and sugar in a heavy ceramic bowl until thoroughly mixed, stirring together with large wooden mixing spoon. Add eggs and rosewater, stirring vigorously. Batter will become very dry, and gradually tougher. Beat mixture until well blended (90-120 minutes). It should be nearly unworkable.<br />
<span class="s3">When batter is approaching a state of solidity, preheat oven to 300</span>°F. Butter pans. Continue to mix batter. When batter has achieved a state of complete solidity, scrape from mixing bowl into pans. Place in oven for 90 minutes, checking occasionally.<br />
Remove from oven and cut into 3/4&quot; slices.<br />
For storage, let oven cool to <span class="s3">100</span>°F and place slices of biscuit bread in oven for 30 minutes to remove any remaining moisture.
