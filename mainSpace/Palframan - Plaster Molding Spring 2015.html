All of the plaster casting recipes from the manuscript can be found <a class="wiki_link" href="Plaster%20Casting%20Recipes%20-%20Spring%202015.html">here</a>. This experiment was conducted in tandem with Gunthild Storeck and her rose is pictured as well.</li><li>We chose a standard white rose to experiment with. The rose was shortened to approximately a third of its initial length and placed in a wax gate. The wax gate and all of the sprues were constructed the week prior out of beeswax and venice red. The wax gate was an elongated pyramid shape. The rose was then cut shorter on the advice of Dr. Smith and reinserted into the wax gate.</li></ul></li></ul><table class="captionBox" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;"><tr><td class="captionedImage"><img src="files/2015_002Spring_labsem_Plaster_Molding_a_Rose_20150309_001.JPG" alt="2015_002Spring_labsem_Plaster_Molding_a_Rose_20150309_001.JPG" title="2015_002Spring_labsem_Plaster_Molding_a_Rose_20150309_001.JPG" style="width: 404px;" /></td></tr><tr><td class="imageCaption">The rose to be molded.

The participants noticed that making the sprue systems was quite a meditative process and proved quite relaxing.
