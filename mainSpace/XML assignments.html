<ul><li><strong>I continued to markup my assigned entries according to our <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qzQJayPlAuPvIsZ6Mx81ktOe4alb9CfxKpUwi2D-bGA/edit" rel="nofollow">protocols</a>. I encountered a few issues</strong><ul><li><strong>It was mentioned in class the other day that users may be interested in the units of measurement that are used in the manuscript, so I decided to tag these. Sometimes, they are straightforward (e.g. &quot;lbs. and &quot;ounces&quot;) but elsewhere I wasn't as sure (e.g. &quot;the size of a walnut&quot;, &quot;a little&quot;, &quot;small balls&quot;, &quot;a lump&quot;). Also, in one of my folios, a tool ( a &quot;limbeck&quot;) functions as a unit of measurement. I ultimately decided to tag it as both as a tool and a unit of measurement, but it did give me brief pause.</strong></li><li><strong>Also, I have an entry (p105v_3) that contains something that seems to be something like marginalia (it contains immediately to the right of the heading that says &quot;see the 15th folio after this&quot;), but it wasn't marked up as marginalia. Not knowing what to do with it, I merely marked it as a &quot;block&quot;.</strong></li><li><strong>I'm not sure how to markup entries that span two folios. At the moment, I'm dealing with this by including various attributes with the &quot;entry&quot; element, but I'm not certain whether this is the most effective/desirable way to take care of this.</strong></li></ul></li></ul><br />
