<br />
<strong>Subject: Application of gold leaf</strong><br />
<br />
Sanded 1A with 1000 grade sand paper before burnishing - had to be mindful of thinner areas of bol<br />
<br />
Burnished 1A with alabaster burnisher - made a burnished square within the square bol on which to apply gold leaf, careful not to burnish anywhere near the masking tape used to maintain gridlines<br />
<br />
<strong>5:30pm</strong><br />
Marjolijn applied alcohol, water, rabbit glue mix to 1A and, immediately after, I applied the gold leaf as quickly as possible.<br />
<br />
<img src="files/IMG_8259.jpg" alt="IMG_8259.jpg" title="IMG_8259.jpg" style="height: 1066px; width: 800px;" /><br />
Noticed scratch lines on gold leaf surface as soon as it made contact with the panel - Marjolijn explained that this may be a result of tension - that the foil is pulling slightly in adhering to the panel. This can be burnished out.
