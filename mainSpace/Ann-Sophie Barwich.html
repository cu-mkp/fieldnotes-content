(that was Donna... I leave it because I am German and stick to authority)<br />

<br />
I am a bench philosopher and historian of science with specialization in neuroscience, general biology and chemistry. I also work on topics in the philosophy of perception and cognitive science. My work is on current and past developments in olfactory research.<br />
<br />
<u>Current research:</u> As a Scholar in the Presidential Scholars in Society and Neuroscience program at the Center for Science and Society, Columbia University, I focus on the role of ‘research routines’ in scientific training and practice. My mentors are Stuart Firestein (Neuroscience) and Christopher Peacocke (Philosophy).<br />
<br />
<u>Research History:</u> I received my PhD at Exeter (Egenis/The Centre for the Study of the Life Sciences) under the supervision of John Dupré in 2013, before taking up a postdoctoral fellowship at the Konrad Lorenz Institute for Evolution and Cognition Research with Werner Callebaut as my scientific advisor. My thesis examined classification and modeling strategies through which scientists have linked odors to a material basis (botanical, chemical, molecular-biological, neurophysiological), and my previous postdoctoral project concerned the role of methodology in measurement and wet-lab discovery.<br />
