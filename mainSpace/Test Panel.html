<strong>Subject: Preparation for test panel</strong><br />
<ul><li>rabbit skin glue must be kept between 40 and 60 degrees Fahrenheit</li><li>first, thin layer of warm glue on front and back on panel (to prevent warping) [should take about ten minutes to dry]</li><li>my board took about half an hour (perhaps too thick a layer of glue, applied with more flexible goat hair brush which was actually more difficult to work with)</li></ul><br />
<strong>2:34-2:37 application, dried 3:30</strong><br />
<strong>First layer gesso, horizontal</strong><br />
<ul><li>white chalk in rabbit skin glue, sift in chalk until it does not sink easily into glue which is kept in water bath (about 50 degrees Fahrenheit)</li><li>paint in thin, parallel, non-overlapping layers with goat hair brush</li><li>first layer looks streaky (application of paint slightly uneven)</li></ul><br />
<strong>3:30-3:36 application, dried 4:13</strong><br />
<strong>Second layer gesso, vertical</strong><br />
<ul><li>paint back with water, sand first layer lightly with 1000 grit sandpaper</li><li>applied gesso with hog hair brush, stiffer brush bristles made application more even (preferable to goat hair for gesso), spreads thinner and more evenly</li></ul><br />
<strong>4:15-4:26 application, dried 4:50</strong><br />
<strong>Third layer gesso, horizontal</strong><br />
<ul><li>,paint back with water,sand with 1000 grit sandpaper</li><li>thin layer with hog hair brush, with three layers, more difficult to see if application is even</li></ul><br />
<strong>4:55-5:03 application, dried overnight</strong><br />
<strong>Fourth layer gesso, vertical</strong><br />
<ul><li>paint back with water</li><li>dried faster between third and fourth layer, becoming more even in white color</li><li>now undried gesso has a more yellow-white tone, easier to see which parts are not yet dry</li></ul><hr />

<strong>Subject: continuing gesso layers</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>11:30-11:39 application, dried 12:00</strong><br />
<strong>Fifth layer gesso, horizontal</strong><br />
<ul><li>more to sand now, striations become more obvious when layers build up, spent about 10 minutes sanding with 1000 grit sandpaper</li><li>paint back with water</li></ul><br />
<strong>12:02-12:19 application, dried 12:44</strong><br />
<strong>Sixth layer gesso, vertical</strong><br />
<ul><li>left to dry in sun (perhaps dried slightly faster)</li><li>more difficult now to sand, needs about 15 minutes sanding</li><li>paint back with water, apply gesso with hog hair brush (every time besides first time)</li></ul><br />
<strong>12:45-1:05 application, dried 1:35</strong><br />
<strong>Seventh layer gesso, horizontal</strong><br />
<ul><li>switch to 220 aluminum Oxide sandpaper (lower grit), easier to sand smooth, much more chalk dust</li><li>paint back with water</li><li>easier to apply paint layers, striations no longer very obvious</li></ul><br />
<strong>1:35-1:57 application, dried 2:34</strong><br />
<strong>Eighth layer gesso, vertical</strong><br />
<ul><li>unsure what accounts for variations in drying time, perhaps not being consistent in thickness of paint application</li><li>striations become more obvious when appling next gesso layer (gesso catches on uneven surface)</li></ul><br />
<strong>3:30-4:45 Sanding</strong><br />
<ul><li>takes about an hour, first sand with rougher (150 grit) sandpaper before using 1000 grit</li><li>perhaps should have sanded more finely with 150 grit sand paper in previous layers because small holes appear</li><li>when smooth, very few holes or evenness catch raking light</li></ul><hr />

<strong>Subject: continue application of bole</strong><br />
<ul><li>made bole with red bole, natural earth from Germany, and water<ul><li>take small amount of bole and water and grind together until fairly smooth and not gritty</li></ul></li><li>heat rabbit skin glue, add small amount of glue to bole mixture until it is an even consistency</li><li>painted 5 layers of bole in test squares 1A and 2A, alternating horizontal and vertical layers, each layer taking about 5-10 minutes to dry<ul><li>although it seems slightly gritty when applying, the bole dried fairly evenly</li></ul></li><li>sand with 1000 grit sandpaper for about half an hour, then rub with cheese cloth, skipped burnishing because I sanded fairly far down</li><li>4:00-4:20pm laid on gold leaf on bole<ul><li>fake gold leaf handles very differently from authentic gold leaf, it is not easy to cut</li><li>first pick gold leaf out of book with knife, lay on pillow, cut to size with knife, pick up with brush (make sure it there is enough static)</li><li>dried around 5:00, tap with burnisher--higher pitch means dried</li><li>burnish, smoother texture (less resistance) means it is fully burnished</li></ul></li><li>then Marjolijn helped me apply more gold leaf to damaged parts, overlap can be burnished</li><li>also applied silverleaf directly to board</li></ul><strong>Observations</strong><br />
<ul><li>2A: verdigris and stand oil pigment layer still sticky to touch but unaffected by touching; paint is fairly even, no brush marks visible (also runs easily, noticeable under tape)</li><li>2B: verdigris and linseed oil pigment layer relatively dry, only slightly sticky, did not even out paintbrush marks</li><li>2C: green earth and stand oil pigment layer not dry, touching leaves fingerprint</li><li>2D: green earth and linseed oil pigment layer least dry of four green pigments, accidentally wiped off a section of paint (noticeably less square than rest of square)</li><li>all translucent, all sharpie lines still visible</li></ul><br />

ASPECTS TO KEEP IN MIND WHEN MAKING FIELD NOTES<br />
<ul><li>note time</li><li>note (changing) conditions in the room</li><li>note temperature of ingredients to be processed (e.g. cold from fridge, room temperature etc.)</li><li>document materials, equipment, and processes in writing and with photographs</li><li>notes on ingredients and equipment (where did you get them? issues of authenticity)</li><li>note precisely the scales and temperatures you used (please indicate how you interpreted imprecise recipe instruction)</li><li>see also our <a href="files/Informal%20Template%20for%20Reconstruction.docx">informal template for recipe reconstructions</a></li></ul><hr />
