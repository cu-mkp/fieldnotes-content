SUBJECT: wax medal carving<br />
<br />
I began working on the carving of the wax medal that Prof. Smith provided us.<br />
As Donna and Joel suggested, I looked for the tools I needed in my apartment.<br />
I started practicing my carving skill on the small portion of wax medal using a butter knife. This tool didn’t convince me, yet the excitement to begin working on the final product took over. I stopped experimenting, and I began carving the wax medal using a thin screw driver available in my drawer at home. While at the beginning I found the wax very hard to carve, after 15 minutes of handling, the wax warmed it up becoming softer and easier to manipulate.<br />
Working at my desk close to the heater helped the process even more.<br />
In less than one hour, I was able to carve a star removing the excess of material around it.<br />
I continued working using a metal spatula to smooth the edges of the star carved out of the wax medal.<br />
Prof. Smith recommended to make the edges of the carved shape slightly slanted towards the outside in order to expect a good sandcasting result.<br />
<strong>Observations</strong><br />
<ol><li>I should continue cleaning the areas around the star edges to make the wax surface smoother than what it looks now.</li><li>At the end of the process, I found more difficult removing the little sticky bits of wax from my work table than carving the wax medal.</li></ol><strong>Photos</strong><br />

SUBJECT: plaster model<br />
<br />
At room temperature we started kneading grey clay in order to form a thick solid block where impress our wax shaped medal.<br />
I used hand soap as a release agent for the mold, placing it on the wax medal before press it on the clay.<br />
With my weight body I put pressure on the wax medal in order to create a deep mold into the soft clay.<br />

<br />
<br />
Prof. Smith showed me how to prepare the plaster in a proportion of 2: 1 (2: powder and 1: lukewarm water). I started the process using ½ cup measurement of powder and less than ½ cup of warm water. After stirring the mix for a couple of minutes in the fume hood, the consistency of the plaster was too creamy. We decided to add another ½ cup of water. The plaster became liquid as we wished and ready to be poured into the mold.<br />
With the use of a sharp metal tool we removed the wax model from the clay.<br />

<br />
After pouring the plaster into the mold, we shacked the whole solid clay block to remove bubble from the plaster surface.<br />

During the next class we will work on sandcasting using <strong>oyster shell in the form of calcium carbonate</strong>
