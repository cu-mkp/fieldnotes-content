<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">I began making verdigris OCTOBER 2, 2015. I took an unremarkable distilled vinegar, placed it in a plastic, lidded container, and suspended the copper plate above it. By the next morning (12 hours later)—seemingly miraculously—the copper was already coated with a thin layer of green rust. The recipe recommends submerging the container underground, so I have mimicked by placing the container under the kitchen sink, as it’s similarly dark and damp.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">By the end of the first week, the vinegar had taken on a sea-green hue, and the container often has condensed beads of moisture on the inside of it. By this morning (NOVEMBER 1), I realized that most of the vinegar had dried, and I replaced the liquid (about ¼ cup). The copper is acquiring a thicker layer of rust, but it’s still less than a millimeter thick. I plan to not disturb the container again for another month, at which point I assume the liquid will need to be replaced again.</span>
