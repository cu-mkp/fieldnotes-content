<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 16px; vertical-align: baseline;">Questions and Food for Thought</span><br />
<ol><li><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 16px; vertical-align: baseline;">Think carefully about the ingredients. Are these comparable to modern ingredients? How are they similar or different? What about their purity? Were they exotic or common? </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 16px; vertical-align: baseline;">What about your modern heating apparatus and cookware, how might this impact authenticity? Could your pots, pans, ladles, ovens, and heating elements change the outcome of a recipe?</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 16px; vertical-align: baseline;">What tacit information has been left out of your recipe? What did you do in your reconstruction that was not discussed by the original author?</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 16px; vertical-align: baseline;">Who wrote your recipe? Why did he or she write it down and/or publish it? </span></li></ol><br />

<br />
<br />
Procedure<br />
1. Scraping<br />
For this leg of the experiment, having removed my copper plate from the vinegar jar and transported it to the lab, I began by scraping the blue verdigris off of the square of copper and onto the ceramic plate with the palette knife. At first I tried to hold the copper by the strings so that I wouldn't touch it too much with my gloves (an attempt to preserve as much of the verdigris as possible and not let it rub off on my gloves) but after a few minutes I found that it was very difficult to manipulate. I unbent the copper and removed the string, proceeding to hold the verdigris-covered copper in my gloved fingers. At first it was difficult to get the verdigris off, as the copper kept bending as I pushed against it with the palette knife. I had to try several different movements with the knife before I found one that was really successful. I ended up placing the copper on the plate and scraping along it with the rounded end of the knife. This pushed the verdigris off very successfully.<img src="files/20161003_111859.jpg" alt="20161003_111859.jpg" title="20161003_111859.jpg" style="height: 139px; width: 230px;" /><br />

The first attempts to scrape off verdigris, using a downward motion and holding the palette knife perpendicular to the copper.<br />

Final, small pile of verdigris, accumulated after about 15 mins of scraping. The verdigris was much lighter in color in the powdered form than it was when it was still on the copper.<br />
<br />
2. Mixing with Vinegar<br />
For the second step, I mixed the powdered verdigris with the vinegar used in the first part of the experiment. After scraping my verdigris into a pile, I added one large drop of vinegar from the end of the palette knife. After mixing it in a bit I noticed that the verdigris was still very dry, so I added another large drop of vinegar. I mixed the vinegar in with the palette knife, making a watery paste that turned darker in color than the powdered verdigris was.<br />

Resulting watery paste. I left it under the hood until dry, about 10 minutes.<br />
<br />
3. Mixing with Oil and Mulling<br />
Once the verdigris was dry again, I divided the pile in half and mixed one half with two drops of walnut oil and one half with one drop of linseed oil. I did the walnut oil first, adding one drop from a pipette, attempting to mix it in, and when I found it too dry adding another drop. Then I mixed it for about a minute with the muller, but I found that there was so little verdigris that it kept getting lost on the edges of the muller. I was afraid that i would spread the verdigris too far so I switched to pressing it under the blade of my palette knife (which I had cleaned off on a paper towel). This seemed to work and the verdigris congealed into blob that resembled my experience of oil paint, though perhaps a bit more liquid.<br />
Then I added a single drop of linseed oil to the other pile. I worked this a little bit longer with the muller, and the single drop seemed to mix in without leaving it too dry. After about five minutes I switched to the palette knife technique, mixing until I had a globby paste (scientific term).<br />

Verdigris with one drop of linseed oil added, before mixing.<br />
<br />
4. Painting<br />
Finally, I painted out my two verdigris oils. Neither painted very well at all. I thought at first the linseed oil one would be better because the texture was more oil paint-like than the walnut on my brush, but when I tried to paint my square it was very very gritty. So was the walnut when I tried to paint that one out as well. Both were very very gritty and not smooth at all. I think that I didn't mull either of them enough, so there were still large bits of copper in the mixture. They both technically worked, but the experience of painting with them was unpleasant because they didn't glide smoothly over the paper. They stuck and caused my brush bristles to split instead of gliding smoothly over the paper. This created a splotchy, grainy finish.<br />
<br />

5. Dried Paint Check<br />
After leaving the paint to dry for a week, I checked today. The color has darkened slightly but there is very little change. It has gotten perhaps a bit greener and less like a teal color. It was a bit grainy to the touch, but definitely dry. The areas where the pigment is darker were more textured than the other areas where it was more thinly spread. None of it crumbled off though, which is what I was a little afraid of it doing.<br />

&lt;head&gt;&lt;m&gt;Verdigris&lt;/m&gt; and another very beautiful, gay green&lt;/head&gt;<br />
&lt;ab&gt;One must not crush it with &lt;m&gt;water&lt;/m&gt; alone, because that makes it fade. To make it beautiful in distemper, some crush it with &lt;m&gt;vinegar&lt;/m&gt;, but that makes it<br />
turn pale and become whitish. To make it beautiful, crush it with &lt;m&gt;urine&lt;/m&gt; and leave it to dry. Then, whenever you like, crush it with &lt;m&gt;oil&lt;/m&gt;. And after you<br />
have collected it with the palette, before you finish cleaning the &lt;m&gt;marble&lt;/m&gt;, crush it &lt;sup&gt;there&lt;/sup&gt; with &lt;m&gt;stil de grain yellow&lt;/m&gt;. And you will have a very<br />

But this way I do utterly dislike, both for that heere is no separation made at all, and also because I feare that the Vinegar doth carry an ill touch with it, either fro the leaden botto or the pewter head or both. And therefore I could wish rather that the same were distilledin a large bodie of glasse with a head or receiver, the same beeing placed in sand or ashes. Note that the best part of the vinegar is the middle part that ariseth, for the first is fainte and phlegmatick, and the last will taste of adustion, because it groweth heavie toward the latter end, and must be urged up with a great fire, and therefore you must now and then taste of that which commeth both in the beginning &amp; towardes the latter end, that you may receive the best by it selfe. <strong>NOTE:</strong> this recipe is for aromatic vinegar and it is not at all clear that the kind of vinegar used for making verdigris is the same kind one would eat or smell.</span></span></li></ol><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 16px; vertical-align: baseline;"><table class="captionBox"><tr><td class="captionedImage"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/WmiWAyjxeaIGMPg9XKNGQ6srMEWKR2ZAu0PlxaZjVvp8mb4cx66ZmU9hTXPPlFDTB718VOa6Sqfhj4et9xcY5mXQ09eEZoe8veB56bgi1FtAyc9P9cahoUxILHkchFuDl4gkGhYt" alt="C0070262-Vinegar_production%2C_19th_century-SPL.jpg" title="C0070262-Vinegar_production%2C_19th_century-SPL.jpg" style="height: 270px; width: 270px;" /></td></tr><tr><td class="imageCaption">C0070262-Vinegar_production%2C_19th_century-SPL.jpg</td></tr></table></span><br />
