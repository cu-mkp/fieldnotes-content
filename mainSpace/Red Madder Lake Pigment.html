 <strong>Location: Columbia University</strong><br />
<strong>Subject: Madder Lake Pigment</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>(Note: All temp in Celsius)</strong> <br />
Took the Madder Lake (which had been left to soak at 6:30 PM on 5 Oct) and began to heat it on hot plate at a minimum heat.<br />
<br />
<hr />
<strong>12:00pm</strong><br />
Increased heat to 1<br />
<hr />
12:03pm<br />
The center of the beaker reaches 70 degrees<br />
The edges are above 70~80 degrees and are starting to form a foam<br />
The heat is lowered to off<br />
<hr />
<strong>12:05</strong><br />
Bubbles starting to form from the bottom of the beaker<br />
Foam is darkening to a light cranberry color with black on top<br />
<hr />
<strong>12:07</strong><br />
Temperature is very unstable, varying between 60 and 80 degrees<br />
<hr />
<strong>12:09</strong><br />
Foam has reduced, temperature is now between 60 and 75 degrees<br />
Smells slightly burnt<br />
Color is a very deep cranberry, not transparent<br />
<hr />
<strong>12:12</strong><br />
Temperature is varying between 65 and 85 degrees, though the heat is off<br />
The foam has reduced almost completely<br />
<hr />
<br />
<strong>12:15</strong><br />
Heat seems to be at approximately 70 degrees<br />
The liquid is now very dark, no more bubbles forming.<br />
<hr />
<strong>12:20</strong><br />
Heat still off but the liquid is measuring at approximately 75 degrees<br />
<hr />
<strong>12:23</strong><br />
Removed from heat entirely<br />
Measuring at approximately 68-71 degrees<br />
<hr />
<strong>12:26</strong><br />
Placed back on the hot plate (the heat is off but it's still warm)<br />
<hr />
<strong>12:28</strong><br />
Turned heat to min. as the solution was ~65 degrees<br />
<hr />
<strong>12:30</strong><br />
Solution approx. 67 degrees<br />
<hr />
<strong>12:55</strong><br />
Solution reaches 80 degrees<br />
<hr />
<strong>1:00</strong><br />
Removed from heat<br />
Checked ph--seems to be about 4<br />
<br />

ASPECTS TO KEEP IN MIND WHEN MAKING FIELD NOTES<br />
<ul><li>note time</li><li>note (changing) conditions in the room</li><li>note temperature of ingredients to be processed (e.g. cold from fridge, room temperature etc.)</li><li>document materials, equipment, and processes in writing and with photographs</li><li>notes on ingredients and equipment (where did you get them? issues of authenticity)</li><li>note precisely the scales and temperatures you used (please indicate how you interpreted imprecise recipe instruction)</li><li>see also our <a href="files/Informal%20Template%20for%20Reconstruction.docx">informal template for recipe reconstructions</a></li></ul><hr />
