<strong>Subject:Setting up verdigris</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>After reading the Merrifield recipes, I decided to try nr. 155, which called for copper strips, strong vinegar, a sealable container, a means for suspending the copper over the vinegar, and a warm place to let the copper/vinegar cure.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>I had several types of vinegar at home; I opted for the white wine vinegar because it had the greatest acidity (7%).</strong><br />
<strong>I poured 50ml into the 200ml mason jar (which was provided by the seminar). Because my piece of copper (similarly provided by the seminar) was already rather small (ca. 1x3 inches), I decided it already counted as a 'strip', so I didn't cut it further. I simply bent it in the middle at about 45 degrees so that I could hang it from the string, which I secured with the lid. Following the recipe, I was careful to keep the copper from contacting the vinegar.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The recipe said to place the container in horse dung in order to incubate it. Clearly that wasn't going to happen in my apartment, but I thought my seed-germination mat would make a good substitute. This mat, intended for horticultural use, heats about 10 degrees warmer than the ambient temperature. The heat is constant. I placed the jar on the mat, which means the heat was only coming from the bottom (whereas the dung version would have had heat coming from all sides).</strong><br />

<strong>The copper is already consistently blue/green. It looks like powder rather than crystals.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>There is slight condensation in the jar and on the copper.</strong><br />

<br />
<strong>The patina is more intense. The bottom edges show the copper color - it appears that as the condensation drips from the strip, it prevents the crystals from forming on the edges.</strong><br />

ASPECTS TO KEEP IN MIND WHEN MAKING FIELD NOTES<br />
<ul><li>note time</li><li>note (changing) conditions in the room</li><li>note temperature of ingredients to be processed (e.g. cold from fridge, room temperature etc.)</li><li>document materials, equipment, and processes in writing and with photographs</li><li>notes on ingredients and equipment (where did you get them? issues of authenticity)</li><li>note precisely the scales and temperatures you used (please indicate how you interpreted imprecise recipe instruction)</li><li>see also our <a href="files/Informal%20Template%20for%20Reconstruction.docx">informal template for recipe reconstructions</a></li></ul><hr />
