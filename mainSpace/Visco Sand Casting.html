 location: 260 Chandler<br />
activity: sandcasting<br />
<br />
instructions based off 118v and class modifications<br />
we brushed each of our plaster molds with dry charcoal<br />
placed them in a metal casting box<br />
we initially use the sand prepared by Ray and Jordan<br />
sprinkle sand mixture onto molds in box, pressing down firmly on borders/boundaries of molds to keep them still<br />
observation: when it is packed the sand mixture gets very hard/ difficult to manipulate<br />
once sides are done continue adding more sprinkles of sand on top and pack it in<br />
Halfway through we run out of sand and have to make more (to fill the larger metal box)<br />
We sifted 3 1/2 cups of pink sand through a sieve to prepare for first half of the mold<br />
gradually added (in 1/4 cup installments) 1 cup of water/sal ammoniac solution , 2 TBs of E&amp;J brandy, and sal ammoniac solution;<br />
work into (stir) correct consistency (not too wet, not too dry) to match Tonny Beentjes's model sand<br />
This is too wet and we must add another (gradually, cumulativley) 1/4 cup of sifted sand.<br />
The excess surface is smoothed with a knife and scraiping.<br />
Flip over the box.<br />
My mold falls out! We reposition it. Tonny notes this is an advantage to sandcasting over plastercasting -the mold can be repositioned/reinserted<br />
Use dowel to make indentations in center and corners.<br />
