<strong>Subject: Recipe interpretation: &quot;pearced them sufficientlie&quot;</strong><br />
While laying out the steps for our culinary reconstruction, Jen and I had differing interpretations of one specific line: &quot;let them [rosemary springs] rest therein till the sirup have pearced them sufficientlie.&quot; At first, it was not clear if this meant that the sugar solution was supposed to &quot;pierce&quot; the rosemary leaved or if the rosemary should be left in long enough to infuse the syrup. In the end, we agreed that the latter interpretation was probably the correct one. <br />

<strong>Subject: Amendment to Recipe Interpretation: manus Christi</strong><br />
During our reconstruction, Jen and I were not clear on what was meant by the specification &quot;manus Christi&quot; (hands of Christ) height in the following line: &quot;then boyle all the sirup which remaineth and is not drunke up in the flowers, to the height of manus Christi&quot;. After researching the possible meaning of the measurement, we found that it is 1) often confused with a 17th c. medicinal candy of the same name and that 2) many contemporary practitioners of culinary reconstructions equate it to either the &quot;thread&quot; stage or the &quot;hard ball&quot; stage of sugar candying (the former being more pliable and than the latter). After our in class discussion, we came to a consensus that this probably referred to the actual height of the syrup mixture as it was heated and began to rise in the pot. Though originally Jen and I figured this might be what the recipe was referring to, we did not have much faith in our original interpretation and resorted to other readings. This has taught us to consider not only outside sources, but also our interpretations when deciphering early modern recipes. <br />
