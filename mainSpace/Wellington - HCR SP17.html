Additional Notes: <br />
<br />
We interpreted the second infusion of rosemary leaves into syrup as being a fresh batch, since it specified putting in “more flowers as before,” even though this seemed difficult to understand, since it resulted in a first batch of candied rosemary that went apparently unused. However, after class discussion, we realize we probably should have interpreted this to mean replacing same rosemary leaves in the syrup to further coat them. <br />
We also relied on outside readings to understand the &quot;height of manus Christi.&quot; Manus Christi referred to both a hard candy used for medicinal purposes, and a temperature; however, it is unclear exactly what that temperature was, and we didn't realize that it might be as simple as understanding the actual height to which syrup will rise while boiling. <br />
