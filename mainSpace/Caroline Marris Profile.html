<span style="display: block; text-align: center;"><strong>BIO</strong></span><span style="display: block; text-align: center;"><br />
</span><span style="display: block; text-align: left;">Caroline Marris is a second-year PhD student in the History Department at Columbia University who focuses mainly on Early Modern Western Europe and the Early Modern Atlantic, with particular emphasis on the late sixteenth/early seventeenth century in England and the Low Countries. She hopes to write a dissertation on the quality of politics on water in the English Channel during this period. Caroline received her BA Hons. in History and English from New York University; outside of work she also practices early modern musical technique in the viola da gamba consort, The Teares of the Muses. She is taking this course to expand her general knowledge of early modern work practices; she hopes these investigative techniques could apply to her study of 16th/17th-century maritime technology.</span><span style="display: block; text-align: center;"><br />
