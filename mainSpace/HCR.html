Please see attached pdf of my in-class presentation for details regarding the recipe, its deciphering, materials, interpreting the quantities and measurements, limitations and liberties taken to reconstruct this recipe, as well as my attempt to translate the 1606 instructions into &quot;modern&quot; recipe language.<br />
<br />
<strong>Final notes:</strong><br />
Recipe took a total of 3 days to make (one day for setting out the ale so it would get stale, one day to let the first brew sit overnight, and a final third day to make the syrup). However the recipe process (mixing ingredients, boiling, etc) itself was quick, at most one hour.<br />
<br />
The final flavor profile of this recreation was similar to that of molasses, but with a distinct taste of licorice and fragrant herb. Whether it actually has healing properties is unclear since no one with a cough ingested it. However, in this recreation the main ingredient (scabiosa) was absent, which might ultimately affect the recreation's potency.
