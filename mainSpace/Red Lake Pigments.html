<span style="color: #1a1a1a;">9:47am</span><br />
<span style="color: #1a1a1a;">Put two sachets of logwood in separate beakers of 200 ml of distilled water and potash and one sachet of logwood in a beaker of 200 ml of tap water and potash, used spoon initially to submerge logwood</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #1a1a1a;">9:47am</span><br />
<span style="color: #1a1a1a;">Put two sachets of brazilwood in separate beakers of 200 ml of distilled water and potash and one sachet of brazilwood 200 ml of tap water and potash, used spoon initially to submerge brazilwood</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #1a1a1a;">9:53am</span><br />
<span style="color: #1a1a1a;">Soaking logwood is significantly more blood red than rather aqueous looking than soaking brazilwood</span><br />

<span style="color: #1a1a1a;">Soaking sachet of brazilwood in 200ml of distilled water and potash (need to soak for 2 hours)</span><br />
<br />
10:18am<br />
Put 0.24g of cochineal into large jar of 500ml distilled water and 300 ml of 0.1 M potassium carbonate (K2C03) solution [potash]<br />
<br />
10:20am<br />
Put jar on lid in water bath on hot plate set at 3<br />
<br />
10:25am<br />
Discussion about what to do and pros/cons of shared substance re: time it takes to boil but we didn't transfer anything<br />
Turned burner up from 3 to 5 following PS instructions to get it to boil<br />
<br />
10:26am<br />
Combined Cindy and Yuan’s solution with SSKK solution (will have to re-separate the solutions into 300ml each)<br />

<br />
10:32am<br />
Dissolving 10g of potash in 50 ml of distilled water WITHOUT heating for now<br />
<br />
10:35am<br />

10:41am<br />
Potash is almost dissolved in water<br />
<br />
10:42am<br />
Reduced heat to 3.5 (after a certain point at 5, the temperature seems to blast, so we decided to reduce)<br />
<br />
10:43am<br />
Potash is dissolved, we are setting solution aside<br />
<img src="files/IMG_8335.jpg" alt="IMG_8335.jpg" title="IMG_8335.jpg" style="height: 314px; width: 241px;" /><br />
<br />

Cochineal is at 80 degrees Celsius<br />
<br />
11:04am<br />
Turned heat up to 5<br />
Concerned that cochineal solution may not boil in that heat is already turned all the way up<br />
<br />
11:06am<br />
Transferring cochineal solution to a beaker and removing from water bath to be directly on hot plate (having turned temperature off for a second) in the hopes of boiling<br />
<img src="files/IMG_8339.jpg" alt="IMG_8339.jpg" title="IMG_8339.jpg" style="height: 324px; width: 245px;" /><br />
<br />
The solution has already cooked down a bit because we now have just over 500ml (combined original solution [SSKK + Cindy/ Yuan] was originally 600ml)<br />
Put beaker on TURNED OFF hot plate<br />
<img src="files/IMG_8344.jpg" alt="IMG_8344.jpg" title="IMG_8344.jpg" style="height: 320px; width: 243px;" /><br />
<br />
Plan to heat directly on hot plate for five minutes in the hopes of boiling<br />
<br />
11:09am<br />
Cochineal solution is 76 degrees Celsius with hot plate TURNED OFF<br />
<br />
11:12am<br />
Turned hot plate back on?<br />
Cochineal solution is at 77 degrees Celsius<br />
<br />
11:19am<br />
Splitting solution into 250ml each in the hopes that two beakers with solution will boil faster than one large beaker<br />
<img src="files/IMG_8346.jpg" alt="IMG_8346.jpg" title="IMG_8346.jpg" style="height: 282px; width: 214px;" /><br />
<br />
11:28am<br />
Rolling boil of cochineal solution in larger beaker, smaller beaker is beginning to bubble<br />
<br />
11:32am<br />
Slowly filtering our (smaller beaker) solution<br />
<img src="files/IMG_8354.jpg" alt="IMG_8354.jpg" title="IMG_8354.jpg" style="height: 314px; width: 237px;" /><img src="files/IMG_8357.jpg" alt="IMG_8357.jpg" title="IMG_8357.jpg" style="height: 310px; width: 234px;" /><br />
<br />
11:34am<br />
Put potash back on heat for a bit to re-dissolve some particles that had formed or had not originally dissolved<br />
<br />
11:35am<br />
Cochineal is at 65 degrees Celsius<br />
<br />
11:38am<br />
Slowly poured in potash solution (drop by drop) to cochineal solution while stirring; achieved effervescence<br />
<img src="files/IMG_8360.jpg" alt="IMG_8360.jpg" title="IMG_8360.jpg" style="height: 265px; width: 201px;" /><br />
<br />
<strong>11:41am</strong><br />
Tested pH – was at 4, slightly acidic – decided to retest pH<br />
<br />
<strong>11:42am</strong><br />
pH is at “6” – this is usable<br />
Cochineal solution smelled like ammonium<br />
<img src="files/IMG_8361.jpg" alt="IMG_8361.jpg" title="IMG_8361.jpg" style="height: 305px; width: 231px;" /><br />
<br />
Our cochineal compared to Cindy and Yuan’s cochineal (below)<br />
<img src="files/IMG_8367.jpg" alt="IMG_8367.jpg" title="IMG_8367.jpg" style="height: 302px; width: 231px;" /><br />
<br />
Cochineal would dissolve in either oil or egg so we are precipitating color onto aluminum in order to retain color<br />
<br />
<strong>BRAZILWOOD</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>11:44am</strong><br />
Put brazilwood sachet and solution into a beaker to put on hot plate at 3<br />
<img src="files/IMG_8368.jpg" alt="IMG_8368.jpg" title="IMG_8368.jpg" style="height: 295px; width: 223px;" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>11:50am</strong><br />
Brazilwood solution is 51 degrees Celsius<br />
<br />
<strong>11:51am</strong><br />
Increased heat to 4<br />
<br />
<strong>11:53am</strong><br />
Dissolved 6g of potash alum into 50 ml of distilled water to more easily control pouring into brazilwood<br />
<br />
<strong>11:56am</strong><br />
Brazilwood solution slight boiling<br />
Smelled more pleasant that cochineal – more like plant<br />
<br />
<strong>11:59am</strong><br />
Reduced temperature to 2<br />
<br />
<strong>12:00pm</strong><br />
Reduced temperature to 1<br />
<br />
<strong>12:01pm</strong><br />
Solution is at 150ml<br />
Removing sachet and squeezing out solution<br />
<img src="files/IMG_8377.jpg" alt="IMG_8377.jpg" title="IMG_8377.jpg" style="height: 341px; width: 258px;" /><br />
<br />
<strong>12:04pm</strong><br />
Poured solution through filter/funnel into jar<br />
<img src="files/IMG_8379.jpg" alt="IMG_8379.jpg" title="IMG_8379.jpg" style="height: 332px; width: 254px;" /><br />
<br />
<strong>12:05pm</strong><br />
Stirring solution while pouring in potash solution; achieved effervescing; shook solution to get scum off edge<br />
Color is very red, not “beet red”<br />
Foam seems to be more solid than cochineal solution’s foam<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>FILTERING</strong><br />
Cochineal with distilled water<br />
Normally leave cochineal to settle but Glasgow told us that the brazilwood doesn't really settle out very much so we might as well pour it (slowly) through filter, leave it filtering over night. Probably the case with the logwood too. What difference does filtering today and letting it sit overnight versus letting it sit overnight and filtering do? (PS)<br />
<br />
<strong>Leave brazilwood solution from earlier to settle</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>1:18pm</strong><br />
Filter: Poured solution of cochineal and distilled water + potash into jar through filter and funnel<br />
At first, quite liquidly, then more viscous and opaque sediment in bright magenta color<br />
<br />
<img src="files/IMG_8396.jpg" alt="IMG_8396.jpg" title="IMG_8396.jpg" style="height: 345px; width: 261px;" /><br />
<br />
1:24pm<br />
Emptying jar with filtered liquid<br />
Plan to wash pigment as many times as necessary with distilled water until filtering clear<br />
<br />
1:26pm<br />
1st wash with 250ml of distilled water<br />
<br />
MISTAKENLY washed sediment down the drain sediment<br />
<img src="files/IMG_8402.jpg" alt="IMG_8402.jpg" title="IMG_8402.jpg" style="height: 344px; width: 260px;" /><br />
<br />
<strong>1:27pm</strong><br />
2nd wash with 100 ml of distilled water<br />
Solution was filtering too quickly, prompted us to look for a hole – Siddhartha noticed small tear<br />
<br />
<strong>1:31PM</strong><br />
Pouring filtered solution through lab grade filter paper in a separate funnel – filtering completely clear. From this, we decide that our pigment is thoroughly washed.<br />
Pouring filtered solution through coffee filter in separate jar as well – lab grade filter is filtering better than coffee filter – liquid is totally clear as opposed to coffee filter jar which is slightly pink but still quite clear<br />
Found that pouring liquid not directly on center, rather down side, may be a more sensitive way to filter re: weight of solution, pressure, etc.<br />
<br />
Filtering the twice filtered refuse again through lab grade filter paper – filtering totally clear<br />
