<span class="s1">Question: </span><br />
<span class="s1">What was the Terra Merita that was used? </span><br />
<span class="s1">Can we use powdered root as a pigment as it? </span><br />
<br />
<span class="s1">Test:</span><br />
<br />
<span class="s1">Try making oil paint with linseed oil. </span><br />
I take dried ground turmeric root and mix it with linseed oil. I use the muller for 15 min to try to make a smooth paint.<br />
I apply the resulting paint to the gesso panel.<br />

<br />
<span class="s1">Does not create smooth paint.</span><br />
<span class="s1">There might be too much fiber? </span><br />
<br />
<span class="s1">Finding a solution:</span><br />
<br />
<span class="s1">What if we made a pigment by using solvent extraction? </span><br />
<span class="s1">Which solvents to use:</span><br />
<span class="s1">Alcohol</span><br />
<span class="s1">Water</span><br />
<br />
<span class="s1">To extract turmeric, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.naturalpigments.com/art-supply-education/terra-merita-pigment/" rel="nofollow">Ethyl acetate is typically used</a>. </span><br />
<span class="s1">Looking at composition, ethanol should have similar properties as a solvent. </span><br />
<span class="s1">Use ever clear grain alcohol </span><br />
<br />
<span class="s1">attempt 1:</span><br />
<br />
<span class="s1">12:30 put 20g of turmeric in a jar. </span><br />
<span class="s1">added 180g of ever clear </span><br />

<br />
Since the first try with grain alcohol yielded more of a goo than a powder, I decided to try acetone rather than grain alcohol<br />
<br />
12:00 - mixed 25g of Turmeric with 180 ml of Acetone swished around a few times (wearing gloves, under fume hood)<br />
<img src="files/2015_001fall_labsem_Foyer_Goldwithoutgold_20151130_9.jpg" alt="2015_001fall_labsem_Foyer_Goldwithoutgold_20151130_9.jpg" title="2015_001fall_labsem_Foyer_Goldwithoutgold_20151130_9.jpg" style="height: 387px; width: 223px;" /><br />
12:45 - Filtered out using coffee filter (still under fume hood)<br />
<img src="files/2015_001fall_labsem_Foyer_Goldwithoutgold_20151130_10.jpg" alt="2015_001fall_labsem_Foyer_Goldwithoutgold_20151130_10.jpg" title="2015_001fall_labsem_Foyer_Goldwithoutgold_20151130_10.jpg" style="height: 452px; width: 800px;" /><br />
12:50 left to evaporate.<br />

the final product resembles the one obtained with the grain alcohol: a paste<br />
it is dark red, almost black in color, but leaves a bright yellow trace. <br />
