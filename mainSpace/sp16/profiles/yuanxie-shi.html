Yuanxie Shi is a MA student in Museum Anthropology program. Coming with a family background of handicraft, she is interested in crafts making, object studies and material culture, specifically the materiality of materials and the process of making. For her MA thesis, she did a disciplinary research (anthropological, historical and art historical) on wooden figurines in the Western museums which were purchased mainly as souvenirs by foreign travelers at treaty ports during the 19th- and 20th- century.
