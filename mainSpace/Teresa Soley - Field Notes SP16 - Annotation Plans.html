<ul><li><span style="color: #222222; font-family: Cambria; font-size: 16px; vertical-align: baseline;"><strong>1.</strong> Soley, Ndungu, and Goldenberg: Gold, Faux Gold, Varnish </span></li><li><span style="color: #222222; font-family: Cambria; font-size: 16px; vertical-align: baseline;"><strong>2.</strong> Our annotation investigates the practice of gilding with gold leaf, imitation gold, and the varnish that is integral to these methods. Each of these areas involves further investigating and supporting each element involved in the larger topic of 'gilding' as described in Ms Fr 640. We are going to practice gilding on wood and gilding on paper. Varnish is involved in the gilding process as well as as a finishing method. </span></li></ul><br />
<br />
<u><span style="font-size: 12px;">Historical questions:</span></u><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 90%;">1) Gilding with real gold</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 90%;">- How gilding would have ultimately impacted the value of the object - was it for decorative purposes or was it a value element, ie. with frames? </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 90%;">- For gilded lettering, was this used for only the capitals or could it have been used for the text in manuscripts? </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 90%;">- Regarding gilding on wood versus gilding on paper, what are the similarities and differences? What about parchment? How did printing impact the value and the working process of gilding? </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 90%;">- In the context of the recipe for Matte Gold, why would the maker want to diminish the lustre of gold? Is he even talking about real gold here, or a substitute?</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 90%;">- In the recipe for Matte Gold, the author specifies: &quot;After that, rub the gilding with a feather and with cotton so that no flaw will remain, then varnish with Flanders varnish that you mix with a bit of spirits in order to make it desiccative.&quot; Why does he specify that &quot;Flanders varnish&quot; be used? Also, why would you have to varnish &quot;gold&quot;? Elsewhere in the recipe he just says &quot;varnish&quot; - can any varnish be used, or does this need to be Flanders varnish be used?</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 90%;">2) Gilding with imitation gold </span><br />
<span style="vertical-align: baseline;">- We are interested in how imitation gold falls into ideas of transformative properties of gold (i.e. in alchemy). Does imitation gold embody the same alchemical of gold despite the fact that it is manufactured rather than occurring in nature. When we make imitation gold, are we practicing alchemy? </span><br />
<span style="vertical-align: baseline;">3) Varnish </span><br />
<span style="vertical-align: baseline;">- What does the author of MS Fr. 640 mean by &quot;Flanders varnish,&quot; which he gives a recipe for? Is &quot;Flanders varnish&quot; a widely known recipe, or something the author names himself? Why does he call it &quot;Flanders varnish&quot;? </span><br />
<span style="vertical-align: baseline;">- How does this compare to actual Flemish varnish recipes? Are there geographic differences between French/Italian and Netherlandish/Northern recipes? What does the author of MS Fr. 640 consider 'normal' varnish? </span><br />
<span style="vertical-align: baseline;">- Regarding the recipe for &quot;Flanders varnish,&quot; what is &quot;<em>blue florey&quot;</em>? Is <em>quicklime</em> safe for us to use? Are there alternatives to these ingredients? </span><br />
