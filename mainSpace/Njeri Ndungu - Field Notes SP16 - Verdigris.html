 <strong>Location: Ndungu Home</strong><br />
<strong>Subject:</strong> Initial set-up of experiment<br />
<br />
<u><em>Purpose</em></u><br />
Practical purpose: Produce verdigris (copper acetate) pigment, historically used to green/blue paint.<br />
Learning purpose: To gain practice in the laboratory environment, considering the safety and procedural protocols required for successful experiment. Also consider which substitutions with contemporary equivalents can be made during historical reconstruction, balancing fidelity to recipe with safety and modern day availability.<br />
<br />
<u><em>Recipe</em></u><br />
Merrywether – 418<br />
<br />
84. <em>To make verdigris</em><br />
Take plates of copper, and suspend them over the vapour of strong vinegar in a jar covered with clay and well closed, so as to be air tight; then put the jar into the dung or refuse of grapes, in the time of the vintage, for the space of 15 days, when you must open the jar, and you will fin the verdigris adhering to those plates. Scrape it away, and return it as before.<br />
<br />
<u><em>Observations:</em></u><br />
<br />
Day 1:<br />
<br />
The copper plate was suspended with string inside of a mason jar containing about 5ml of 20% acetic acid as shown below.<br />
<br />

</script><br />
<br />
During transportation, the acid had begun to evaporate within the jar, condensing on the inside walls and move around inside the jar coating the sides of the jar. The plate was suspended high in the jar to avoid coming in contact with the sides of the plate for this purpose. The jar was placed on a high shelf with temperatures ranging between 22- 27 degrees C. The shelf is open to indirect sunlight. There is minimal moisture accessible. Perhaps would be better to have smooth mason jar for easier observations.<br />

After about 16 hours the copper plate had turned a greenish blue color. The texture of the plate seemed essentially the same, the green color following the dents and folds of the sheet. It did provide a matte/ rough texture with the overall color change. The color change appears to have occurred evenly over the entire plate, perhaps only slightly less has formed at the top of the plate where the copper color appears to peak through. There is no change in the color or features of the acetic acid, the acid that had condensed onto the sides of the jar have now collected back at the bottom.<br />

There appears to be no change or development to the copper plate. It is still the same greenish blue color and the acid is still clear.<br />

There appears to be no change to the copper plate. Perhaps this is due to the fact that I have decided to bypass the step requiring the jar be put in “dung or grape waste.” I interpret this to mean kept warm. I have wrapped the jar in an old scarf and placed it in a dark, dry corner for the weekend.<br />

The warming apparatus appeared to have been a bit too successful. The volatile 20% acetic acid has warmed and evaporated inside of the jar, condensing on the walls of the jar and the copper plate. The condensed acid then dripped from the plate into the acid at the bottom of the jar, taking some of the vertigris with it and tinting the acid blue. The jar was removed from the warming apparatus and placed back on the original shelf.<br />

There appears to be little change to the system. The copper plate appears to be a slightly darker blue color, but this may simply be due to the fact that it is now wet and saturated with the acetic acid.<br />

There appear to be little to no change in the system. Assessing the system once more before preparing for transportation has shown that the verdigris from the bottom of the plate on one side has been completely stripped off of the plate and the copper plate has been exposed beneath it. The string suspending the copper plate has tinted blue.<br />

Takes a bit of working to get back to the smooth texture it had been earlier</li><li>Still quite translucent/ dilute pigment, mortar does not crush pigment as effectively as the muller appears to.</li><li>Gather paint into small pool on glass by scraping together with the edge of a palette knife</li><li>Used a clean (hogs hair) short bristle brush to paint onto the prepared gesso board (get details on board preparation) in section 3A.</li><li>Very translucent when applied to the board</li><li>Appears to be primarily clear oil with a few blue pigments suspended</li><li>After drying the blue tint of the oil becomes more apparent but still quite a bit more translucent than it was on the board.</li><li>Specks of pigment are evident in the not very consistently applied paint</li></ul><br />
Trial 2:<br />
<ul><li>Repeated the process using only one drop of walnut stand oil, about 3 palette tips full of verdigris and grinding with the muller instead</li><li>Much easier grinding process</li><li>The pigments appear to be uniformly incorporated into the oil quite soon after beginning to grind (about 15 seconds)</li><li>Ground for about 1 minute (class was essentially over)</li><li>Still quite translucent but a bit more opaque than last trial</li><li>Gather pigment together with edge of palette knife</li><li>Painted onto section 3B.</li><li>Applies quite thinly, surprisingly translucent compared to the color on the ‘palette’</li><li>After drying the strokes of the brush (though perhaps these are from the gesso layer beneath) become quite evident.</li><li>Though applied smoothly, there are about as many suspended pigment fragments in this layer as in first trial.</li><li>Dries to about the same color as original</li><li>Will try again using twice as much pigment and perhaps half as much oil</li></ul><br />
