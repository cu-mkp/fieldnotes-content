# fieldnotes-content
Html content pages for M&amp;K fieldnotes
Works in tandem with https://github.com/cu-mkp/fieldnotes-restructuring (where code to reorganize and structure the html pages is housed)

# `content/`
Within `content/`, files are organized by semester, from fa14 to fa18.

There are two other folders:
1. `no-content-or-duplicate/` = any files which are blank or contain no content other than template info; files with header-like text but no other content, particularly if the content can then not be placed (i.e., assigned to a semester or a person); and files which are exact or incomplete duplicates of other files.
       a. if these files were deleted, removed, or lost, it would not really affect the fieldnotes archive
2. `reference/` = files with teaching or research resources provided to students over the semesters as reference material; teaching materials such as tutorials, scheduling, etc.  
       a. these files are not so helpful as an archive of student fieldnotes, but may be of use for the Research and Teaching Companion or elsewhere for M&K
