And stir continuously over a charcoal fire until the sandarac is well melted, which you will know by taking a little of the said varnish on a plate and, if it is fat enough when you handle it with a finger, it is ready. And for one pound of lavender spike oil, you should put five ounces of ground sandarac. Some only put in four ounces but this is not as good, nor as fat. The former one dries promptly. To avoid the trouble of polishing their ebony, framemakers varnish it with this. So do guitarmakers. This [varnish] is not as fitting for paintings as fine turpentine varnish, good though it is for the paintings&#39; moldings. When linseed varnish was in use, one would not commonly varnish the landscape of a painting because it would turn the landscape yellow. But with turpentine varnish one varnishes everywhere. Instead of sandarac, you can add to it pulverized mastic drop by drop[111] or otherwise, and it will dry more quickly.&lt;/ab&gt;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lt;ab id=&quot;p004r_b1b&quot;&gt;If you want to varnish plaster or a wall, first put on your glue de retaille, very hot, because if cold it would not penetrate the wall at all.

Then add to one pound of the oil thus boiled a piece of black pitch the size of a walnut and as much wheat as can be cupped in two hands [113][114], without removing the garlic and onions, and allow to boil together for a good fifteen minutes. Once the pitch is well melted and the oil becomes opaque, you can remove it from the fire. Then, to varnish, place your iron over a warm charcoal fire and apply with a feather or a brush.

When it is all melted, try some on your knife and if you see that it is too thick, add a little of turpentine oil, and if it is not enough, add some mastic. And in that way it will be done, and cover it so no dirt get into it. When you want to make some, pay attention to separate and choose the mastic white and pure of any dirt and dust and black mache[632]. And if you clean it and dry it to get it well white and neat, it will be even better, because if you don&#39;t purge it properly its dusts and marks will be also powdered into it, will stick to the varnish and when you will apply it on some white or other pink, it will seem dusted and stained. Once you choose it right, powder it in a mortar and sieve it finely and then mix it with oil as aforesaid. But if you want to make some more scrupulously, take a drop from the mastic as you know, powder, sieve and mix, and you will have something peculiar for small creations. Pay attention when you are varnishing to not breathe on it for it will make the varnish white and thick. &lt;/ab&gt;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lt;note id=&quot;p097v_c1a&quot;&gt; It dries almost as you are working on it. &lt;/note&gt;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lt;note id=&quot;p097v_c1b&quot;&gt; We note that this varnish is not thick enough when it doesn&#39;t hold on oil paintings as its consistence is like water.

When you want to use some, make a small hole in the bottle stopper and pour some and close it again each time and apply it on gold.
