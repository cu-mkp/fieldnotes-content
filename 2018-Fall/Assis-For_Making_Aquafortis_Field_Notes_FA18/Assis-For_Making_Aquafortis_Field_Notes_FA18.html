<p>65% nitric acid was dilluted to 250ml of 50% nitric acid by following calculation c1v1=c2v2:</p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>65% * v1 = 50*250</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>v1=50*250/65=192(ml) of 65% nitric acid</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>250-192 = 58ml of distilled water</p>
<p>192ml of nitric acid was poured slowly into 58ml of distilled water to make 250ml of 50% nitric acid.</p>

<p><strong>Subject: Applyng “aquafortis” to steel</strong></p>
<p>In order to test the efficacy of the aquafortis reconstructed according to the recipe in Ms. Fr. 640, fol. 75r, the solutions made in the previous entry were applied to steel (low-carbon bloomery steel made from scraps of the Greenwich armor project) according to an interpretation of the the instructions on fol. 11v “Color of damascene steel on knives,” as follows:</p>
<p>Part 1: Aquafortis with copper(II) sulfate</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Two tablespoons of clay powder were mixed with 7 tablespoons of aquafortis made with copper(II) sulfate to create a malleable paste. This was mixed by until the paste’s consistency was uniform.</p>
<p>The paste was then rubbed on both sides of the steel - one side polished and the other not.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Immediately upon applying the paste with my hand, a rugged layer seemed to have formed underneath the paste. Moving the paste aside and revealing the steel underneath showed a red layer similar to rust.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>

</tbody>

<p>The paste was rubbed in for ~7 minutes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>~¼ standard paper cup with sand was poured into a bowl. The steel covered with the paste was dipped into the bowl, coating the steel with sand. This layer was then scraped away from the steel with my fingers, until leaving the steel clean of both aquafortis paste and sand.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>It seemed like a quick and easy solution to remove the paste from the steel- absorbing the liquid and scraping any residue from the surface.</p>

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Immediately upon applying the paste with my hand, a rugged layer seemed to have formed underneath the paste. Moving the paste aside and revealing the steel underneath showed a red layer similar to rust - much like with the copper(II) sulfate paste.</p>
</blockquote></li>

<p>The paste was rubbed in for ~7 minutes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>~¼ standard paper cup with sand was poured into a bowl. The steel covered with the paste was dipped into the bowl, coating the steel with sand. This layer was then scraped away from the steel with my fingers, until leaving the steel clean of both aquafortis paste and sand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Part 3: Nitric Acid Paste</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Two tablespoons of clay powder were mixed with 7 tablespoons of 50% nitric acid to create a malleable paste. This was mixed by until the paste’s consistency was uniform.</p>
<p>The paste was then rubbed on both sides of the steel - one side polished and the other not.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Immediately upon applying the paste with my hand, the paste and steel plate produced heat. Like with the two previous applications, a rugged layer seemed to have formed underneath the paste. Moving the paste aside and revealing the steel underneath showed a layer similar to rust.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>The consistency of the paste was much more chunky and less smooth than with the homemade aquafortis.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>The color of the rust was significantly less red than the other two applications.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<p>The paste was rubbed in for ~5 minutes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>~¼ standard paper cup with sand was poured into a bowl. The steel covered with the paste was dipped into the bowl, coating the steel with sand. This layer was then scraped away from the steel with my fingers, until leaving the steel clean of both aquafortis paste and sand.</p>

<p><strong>Subject: Removing “aquafortis” from modern steel</strong></p>
<p>The aquafortis paste applied on 2018.12.12 had hardened on the steel plate.</p>
<p>First, sand was poured onto the surface of the aquafortis with Copper(II) Sulfate and was rubbed with fingers on the surface to scrape away the hardened paste. This did not work since the paste was too hard. I dipped my fingers in water and then began to slowly saturate the hard paste with water until it began to turn back into a paste again. Sand was then used to rub and scrape off the remaining paste and hard aquafortis residue. Still, much force needed to be applied to remove some of the residue on the surface.</p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>No raised or rugged surface layer was as apparent underneath the aquafortis layer as with the bloomery steel from the previous experiement, but there was some noticeable discoloration of the modern steel after the removal of the copper(II) sulfate layer (see photo):</p>
</blockquote></li>

<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>The hardened surface, even after saturating it with water, was very hard to remove. Since it was on the same plate as the other layers, cross-contamination was unavoidable while adding water to soften the hardened paste because of the paste and water dripping to all sides.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<p>The same removal method was used with the iron(II) sulfate layer.</p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>The surface had discoloration similar to the copper(II) sulfate, but did not appear as red, with only slight “staining.” See Photo:</p>

<p>The nitric acid paste was removed using the same method mentioned above.</p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Upon removal of the nitric acid, the harded paste felt much more “spotty” and less uniformly spread over the surface of the steel. Streaks of hardened paste instead of a uniform layer aided in the spot removal of the aquafortis paste.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>The staining on the surface of the steel that remained after the removal of the paste was very similar to patterns that can be found on damascus steel (or Wootz steel).</p>
