<p>The container with the sourdough opened on the way home and spilled in the bag. Only about a quarter cup was salvageable.</p>
<p>Ingredients: ¼ cup of starter</p>
<p>Scant 2/4 cup of all purpose unbleached flour</p>
<p>¼ water (+ ~3 tablespoons)</p>
<p>(1 part starter, scant 2 parts flour, 1 part water + a little more water to smoothen texture)</p>
<p>Mixed ingredients until a uniform mixture was recieved</p>
<p>Based on my partners tacit knowledge with bread making, it seemed as though there was not enough water in the mixture.</p>
<p>The total amount of material added to the mixture was 1 cup and 3 tablespoons.</p>
<p>This was left outside in room temperature of about 70F.</p>

<p>The amount of starter poured into a measuring cup from the bowl was ⅔ cup.</p>
<p>Missing third must have been left as uncollected residue in bowl.</p>
<p>A new mixture was made:</p>
<p>Ingredients: ⅔ Cup of starter</p>
<p>⅔ Cup water (+ ~4 tbs)</p>
<p>4/3 scant flour</p>
<p>(1 part starter, scant 2 parts flour, 1 part water + a little more water to smoothen texture)</p>

<p>Take of a Bushell of the whitest meale &amp; 4<sup>th</sup> part to ferment with halfe a pint of new-yeast (if it be stale less will serve) a small handful of salt dissolved in warme water, &amp; three quarts of milke; an hour after; add the rest of the flower, which you shall temper but slightly; then <em>[</em>turne<em>]</em> the part &amp; let it rise in small wooden-dishe, then set it into the oven; an hower is sufficient; when drawne, let them cool edge-ways.</p>
<p>It soon became apparent to me that the task of translation is difficult without any knowledge of what I was doing, or how the process is roughly supposed to look like. In order to translate and convert the amounts and ingredients I needed a semblence of an idea of what ingredients actually go into bread making, and how much of them. The terminology was also a hinderance, and only after it was pointed out to me by my partner that the amounts here probably imply yeast and not soursough starter, did I decide to go online and follow a contemporary sourdough recipe.</p>

<p>Homemade sour dough recipe Step by Step (<a href="http://www.girlversusdough.com/2014/07/07/homemade-sourdough-bread/"><em>http://www.girlversusdough.com/2014/07/07/homemade-sourdough-bread/</em></a>)</p>
<p>Ingredients: 1¼ cups warm water (about 115 degrees F)<br />
1½ teaspoons active dry yeast<br />
2 cups sourdough starter<br />
4 to 4½ cups all-purpose flour (added ~1 more cup while kneading)<br />
1 scant tablespoon salt</p>
<p>This recipe was modifed to accomodate the amount of sourdough I had: <strong>For all of the ingredients I halved the quantites. Any requirements for machinery were substituted by hand.</strong></p>
<p>Directions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><blockquote>
<p>In a large bowl or bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine warm water and yeast. Stir to dissolve yeast, then let sit 5 minutes so yeast can fully dissolve.</p>

<p>Procedures were followed step by step except for step 4- I did not have the risen dough, figuring the ball I had was already halved because of the ingredients.</p>
<p>The bread was delicious.</p>

<p>Using this as a starting point, I had reduced the proportions as following</p>

<p>“make your dow with the remainder of the meale but temper it moderately, or very little;”</p>
<p>After using 2/6 parts of the flour. The Remainder is 4/6. The sourdough starter is roughly 3/6 parts. Therefore the ratio of flour to starter is 4:3.</p>

<p>This process was very much like kneading the dough in the previous attempt. This time, I covered my hands with flour constantly to prevent sticking, and furthermore kneading in the bowl and not on a table. This reduced the amount of wasted material and made the process easier.</p>
