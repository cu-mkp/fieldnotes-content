<p>Black varnish for sword guard, bands for trunks, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Take linseed oil or more cheaply, walnut oil, and rid it of grease with garlic &amp; <del>onions</del><sup>+hog's fennel some also add bread crusts</sup>, which you will boil in it for a good quarter of an hour. Next, put in one lb of the oil thus boiled a piece of black pitch the size of a walnut &amp; a double handful of grains of wheat, without removing the garlic &amp; onions and let it boil together for a good quarter of an hour. And when the pitch is well melted &amp; when the oil has body, you can remove it from the fire. Then, to varnish, place your iron over a low charcoal fire &amp; apply your varnish with a feather or a brosse. And when you see that it no longer smokes, it is done and your varnish is dry.</p>
<p>For excellent black varnish, add two or three paternoster beads of jet among the rest.</p>
<p>Some consider walnut oil better.</p>
<p>If there is a lot of varnish, it needs to boil for at least half a day, for it is better the more it boils. It is dangerous if the fire catches within, if it goes over the top, and is hard to extinguish. Make this therefore in a courtyard or an open space.</p>
<p>In five or six lb of oil, one must put one lb of galipot, which costs 4 sols, &amp; some peeled garlic cloves. This varnish in and of itself is not black, but it blackens over the fire.</p>

<p><strong>Aim:</strong> I will reconstruct “Black Varnish for sword guard, bands for trunks” and “excellent black varnish [made with jet]” on fol. 4v of Ms. Fr. 640. In reconstructing these two types of black varnish, I aim to explore what this “black varnish” was and why one would want to use it on armor. For each varnish, I will explore its 1) visual effects; 2) degree of protection from rust (Tavares’ claim); 3) protecting abilities on the battlefield (forcefully carving into the varnished metal) [abandoned later].</p>
<p>In comparing the recipe “black varnish for sword guard” with the “excellent black varnish [made with two or three paternoster beads of jet]” (noted as a variation to the first recipe on fol. 4v), I hope to be able to get a better understanding of what this black varnish was and what its purposes might be in the context of armor.</p>

<p><strong>Decision re ingredients </strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Degraisser</em> - Garlic, <del>Onions</del>, Hog’s fennel, Bread crusts. </strong></p>
<p>One important decision I made prior to my reconstruction was to skip the first part of the recipe that describes how to <em>desgraisser</em> (“rid of grease”) the oil by adding garlic, <del>onions</del> hog’s fennel and bread crusts. My assumption was that “degreasing” here meant to rid the oil of fat, a process I deemed similar to the modern-day preparation of cold-pressed linseed oil in which the latter is cleared of fatty acids.</p>
<p>Because I thus chose to skip this step, the only ingredients I needed were: linseed oil, black pitch, grains of wheat, jet and iron.</p>
<p><strong>Linseed oil </strong></p>
<p>I will be using natural cold-pressed linseed oil from Kremer.</p>

<p><strong>Black pitch (Colophony)</strong></p>
<p>It was difficult to establish the meaning and composition of black pitch as it was understood by the author-practitioner. The author-practitioner himself is unclear about this material. Sometimes he refers to it as a rosin, in other entries it is referred to as a resin. Early modern dictionaries or sources do not provide much clarity either. Apparently, black pitch could mean a number of different things and could even have been a compound consisting of various materials. Although it is thus not clear what the author-practitioner means when he says use black pitch, we do know this material had to be solid. This is implied by his suggestion that the amount to use should be “the size of walnut.”</p>
<p>One material frequently associated with pitch is colophony. According to a seventeenth-century dictionary by Antoine Furetière, colophony is a resin from pine or other trees and comes in both lighter or darker forms.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Colophony is also mentioned by the author-practitioner, who says that it “is nothing other than a resin cooked again” and is also “known as <em>pix graeca</em>”—greek pitch (fol. 3r and 3v). This description resonates with the words of the sixteenth-century physician Pietro Andrea Mattioli (1501–1577):</p>
<p>“What is commonly called Pece di Spagna, pece greca, and colophony, is nothing but resin boiled in the manner described by Dioscorides.”<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Research I conducted after my reconstruction led me to the work of the eighteenth-century chemist Pierre François Tingry, which provides more insight into the possible meaning of black pitch. His detailed section devoted to this material, entitled “Black solid pitch with a smooth shining surface,” is worth quoting at length:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Black smooth pitch has often been confounded with naval pitch; and these denominations have even been considered as synonymous. Black pitch is a constant object of commerce; but naval pitch is prepared in the sea ports at the time when it is employed. Black pitch, which is transported in casks, is of a darker or lighter colour. It appears to be dry and friable, but flows and extends itself when exposed to a mean temperature. It is believed to be a compound of the more solid part of tar mixed over the fire with resin. Black pitch of a good quality, when broken by a sudden stroke, ought to be smooth, pulverulent, and exceedingly brilliant on the fracture. This kind of pitch is that used by locksmiths for varnishing articles which they wish to preserve for rust, such as locks, latches, and bolts destined for the doors of cellars, and of other places exposed to moisture. For this purpose, nothing is necessary but to heat the article, and to rub over it a piece of this pitch, partly wrapped up in paper, that it may not stick to the hand. The heat of the metal liquefies the pitch; and as soon as it dries the resinous part that has been applied, the result is a black, durable and shining varnish.<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tingry’s rich and instructive description highlights a number of similarities between colophony and black pitch: both are solid, dry and friable when cut up, come in different hues, and have a brilliant quality to them. Although more research is still needed to determine the precise composition of the compound black pitch, for the purposes of my reconstruction, colophony seemed a most reasonable approximation.</p>
<p>I used Dark brown colophony from Kremer.</p>

<p><strong>Grains of wheat </strong></p>
<p>I used Bob's Red Mill Organic Wheat, Hard Red Spring wheat berries (bought at Whole Foods, New York).</p>
<p><strong>Jet </strong></p>
<p>According to <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Okouu9SBGrEKg-byIMPkvpYGgpemoFZuyh6vhqO_swo/edit"><em>Cleo Nisse</em></a>: “Jet is a variety of lignite (essentially fossilized wood) that is characteristically a black or dark brown material.<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Jet has a long history of use in jewelry, it can be polished to a high shine, is relatively soft and so easy to work, and is relatively lightweight.Whitby in the British Isles is a particularly well known source of jet, and the jet bought for this experiment was acquired from there, but it was also mined in France.<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Interestingly, jet seems to be absent from the secondary literature as a possible basis for the production of black pigment.<a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>I used the same type of jet as Cleo Nisse.</p>

<p><strong>Amounts</strong></p>
<p><strong>Linseed oil </strong></p>
<p>The A-P writes that (after you have degreased the oil) you should “put in <strong>one</strong> <strong>lb of the oil thus boiled</strong> a piece of black pitch”</p>
<p>I reduced this amount to 100 ml:</p>
<p>1 lb = 450 ml</p>
<p>100 ml = 450 ÷ 4.5</p>
<p>So the amount of all ingredients had to be divided by 4.5</p>

<p><strong>Colophony (black pitch)</strong></p>
<p>The A-P writes “Next, put in one lb of the oil thus boiled <strong>a piece of black pitch the size of a walnut</strong>”</p>
<p>The question was, what was “the size of a walnut” in the sixteenth-century?</p>
<p>I have been in touch with Doris Oltrogge (email conversation, 27 November 2018, 6:16 PM -- Pamela H. Smith was copied in this email) about this, who provided the following information:</p>
<p>“the size of walnuts in the sixteenth century: the Kreuterbuch of Lonicerus (I used the German edition of 1573 = Adam Lonicerus: Kreuterbuch, kunstliche Conterfeytunge ...Frankfurt / Main, Egenolffs Erben, 1573), fol. XCVv distinguishes between three varieties of &quot;Nux Iuglans&quot;, the very large, also called &quot;pferdtsnuß&quot; (horse nuts&quot;) which according to Lonicerus can have the size of a fist, the middle sized nuts and the small &quot;steinnuß&quot; (stone nuts). This means that already in the sixteenth century the three varieties of nut fruits were known:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><blockquote>
<p>the large <em>noix de jauge</em> (I cannot find an English term) which according to Noel Chomel: Dictionnaire oeconomique ..., Paris 1767, vol. 2, p. 657,occurred especially in Haute-Provence and whose size Johann Georg Krünitz: Oeconomische Encyclopädie, Berlin 1806, vol. 103, p. 34 describes as about 4 inches long and 3 inches thick (which means about 10 cm / 7,5 cm in that period and area)</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p><strong>the &quot;normal&quot; walnut which most probably had a similar size like the &quot;normal&quot; European walnuts today (about 4-6 cm long and 2,5-3 cm thick)</strong></p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>very small and hard walnuts</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ol>
<p>This makes it difficult to decide which type of walnut the author-practitioner had in mind. But since it seems from all sources I consulted that the size of the noix de jauge or horse walnut was considered to be something special and the author-practitioner does not specify his walnut, <strong>I think that the walnut should be identified with the &quot;normal&quot; European walnut.</strong>The exact size between 4-6 cm / 2,5-3 cm can, however, not be determined.”</p>
<p>I used a raw walnut from the brand <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Shell-Walnuts-Pound-Bag-Nuts/dp/B00BWV22DE/ref=sr_1_1_a_it?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1543871783&amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;keywords=whole%2Bwalnuts%2Bin%2Bshell&amp;th=1"><em>Oh! Nuts</em></a> as a “model” for determining the size of the colophony.</p>
<p>I used a walnut of about 4 cm long, 3 cm thick.</p>
<p>Since I had to divide everything by 4.5, I used a piece of colophony that was about a quarter of the size of this walnut.</p>

<p><strong>Grains of wheat </strong></p>
<p>The author-practitioner writes:<br />
“Next, put in one lb of the oil thus boiled a piece of black pitch the size of a walnut &amp; <strong>a double handful of grains of wheat</strong>, without removing the garlic &amp; onions and let it boil together for a good quarter of an hour. “</p>
<p>Since I had to divide everything by 4.5, I would work with about half a handful of grains.</p>

<p><strong>Jet</strong></p>
<p>According to the author you should “add <strong>two or three paternoster beads of jet</strong> among the rest.”</p>
<p>It was difficult to determine the size of paternoster beads.</p>
<p>I have been in touch with Doris Oltrogge about this (email conversation, 27 November, 6:16 PM. Pamela H. Smith was copied in this email):</p>
<p>Paternoster beads: the paternoster (the medieval and early modern name for the rosary) is a chain of 55 beads for counting the Ave Maria and Our Father prayers. Rosaries were in use since the late Middle Ages and their use was especially promoted since the Counter Reformation. Their materials and size varied considerably, simple rosaries were made of bone, luxury examples of ivory, corals, or more or less precious stones among them also jet. The surviving late medieval and early modern rosaries belong mostly to this luxury class. Some early modern jet rosaries are preserved, see e.g. Liselotte Zemmer-Plank: Textile Grabfunde und ein Gagat-Rosenkranz aus der Gruft des Freiherrn Michael von Wolkenstein-Rodenegg, in: Festgabe für Erich Egg, Innsbruck 1985, pp. 24-38. The size of the beads could vary. There are some rosaries in the Metropolitan Museum but I do not remember if there is a jet rosary on display)</p>
<p>The author of the website <a href="https://paternosters.blogspot.com/"><em>https://paternosters.blogspot.com/</em></a> analyses two paintings from the 16th century (One dating from 1529 and the other from 1573) depicting figures holding rosaries:</p>
<p>(scroll down to “zooming at the prado”).</p>
<p>She's trying to figure out the size of the beads and makes a distinction between “ave-beads” (the smaller ones) and the “pater beads” (the bigger ones).</p>
<p>She suggests that the black ave beads in the first painting could be depicting beads made of jet and &quot;Comparing them with the width of [the figure's] fingers, they look to be about 10 to 12mm in diameter [...] The Pater beads are probably gold (most likely gilded silver), round, and only a little larger than the Ave beads -- which is interesting: Paters are often bigger than this, relative to the Aves&quot;</p>
<p>As for the second painting: &quot;These are bigger than Mr. Gonzaga's beads, perhaps in the 16mm to 18mm range. All we see in this case is plain round beads with no visible Paters or ornaments&quot;</p>
<p>Since I did not have any other leads about the size of one paternoster bead, I used this author’s line of reasoning and took her 16-18 mm range as a standard for one paternoster bead.</p>
<p>The amount used was thus as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>two paternoster beads = 2 x 18 mm = 36 mm</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>36 mm divided by about 4.5 (for convenience I used 4): 9 mm</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<p>So I used a piece of jet about 9 mm.</p>

<p><strong>Grinding the colophony </strong></p>
<p>In order to only have to grind once, I decided to grind the colophony for both reconstructions at the same time and then to divide the powdery substance in half at the end.</p>
<p>Experience has taught the M&amp;K team that ground up colophony (or other materials) stick to the mortar, so it is advisable to use a little bit more colophony.</p>
<p>The colophony was very easy to grind. It immediately broke into small pieces with very little pressure from the pestle. Very much like crystal sugar.</p>
<p>The more I ground it, the more the colophony turned into a light yellow powder (almost like sand).</p>
<p>It was a bit harder to grind up the last small pieces of colophony.</p>
<p>The power was rather dusty and as I was grinding the remaining pieces of colophony, it blew up small puffs of smoke.</p>
<p>Powder felt sticky on my hands.</p>
<p>It took about 7 minutes to grind the colophony into a powder.</p>

<p><strong>Cutting and grinding jet (11:32)</strong></p>
<p>Pamela Smith tried to hammer it and to cut it with a knife, but this did not work. She therefore used a jeweler saw to make an incision and then hit it with a hammer, to break it in two.</p>
<p>The jet had a bluish color inside.</p>
<p>Grinding the jet straight into the mortar with a pestle didn’t work - chunks of Jet flew out of the mortar.</p>
<p>I used a plastic zip bag to try to contain the pieces of jet.</p>
<p>But in grinding, the jet broke through the plastic, the plastic tore and mixed in with the jet.</p>
<p>I tried placing a blue rag over the plastic bag to soften the blow of the pestle.</p>
<p>The plastic still tore.</p>
<p>I used a piece of paper instead of a plastic bag. This tore too and piece of jet stuck to the paper.</p>
<p>Although I managed to grind it into smaller pieces, it had not shaped into a powder yet -- even after 30 minutes of grinding.</p>
<p>When crushed up, the pieces of jet looked like small blue shards of glass.</p>
<p>I put the jet pieces into a paper envelope and covered it in a zip bag. Then hammered onto the envelope on the floor to protect the stone counter.</p>
<p>My assumption going into this reconstruction was that the jet had to be crushed or ground, but I might be wrong.</p>
<p>I decided that I would not be able to grind it any finer without loosing more jet and to see what would happen if I added the ingredient to the oil.</p>

<p><strong>Thoughts and reflections </strong></p>
<p><strong>Bringing oil to a boil</strong></p>
<p>Having thus skipped the introductory part of the recipe, the first step in my reconstruction was to bring the linseed oil to a boil. This proved less straightforward than the instructions made it out to be. Even with the hotplate turned on full, the oil would not get hotter than 330 degrees Celsius. When after an hour, the oil had still not gotten closer to boiling point (340 degrees Celsius), I decided the hot plate was probably limited and this was as hot as the oil was going to get. My second, ultimately abrupted, reconstruction of black varnish with jet, illustrated that it was the volume of the beaker that proved instrumental. In this trial I had replaced the 500 ml beaker for one of 1 liter. This seemed to work. The oil reached boiling point much faster than in experiment 1, where we only got the oil up to 330 degrees. Unfortunately the oil autoignited almost immediately and I had to abrupt my experiment.</p>
<p>Coming back to the first reconstruction, it was interesting to observe that in the process of boiling, the hue of the oil had changed from a golden yellow to a very light amber. The consistency appeared to have remained the same: it was still very watery.</p>
<p><strong>Adding black pitch (colophony) and grains of wheat </strong></p>
<p>The recipe now called for <em>poix noire</em> (“black pitch”), “the size of a walnut,” and “a double handful of grains of wheat.</p>
<p><em><strong>Black Pitch (colophony)</strong></em></p>
<p>My assumption prior to the reconstruction was that the colophony (or black pitch) would serve as a colorant. When I had pounded the colophony in a mortar, however, the resulting powder was of a light yellow tint, which led me to adjust my believe that it would color the varnish. My reconstruction confirmed this: when I added the colophony to the hot oil, there was little change in color visible and the liquid only turned from a light to a dark amber at best, instead of to the expected black. It was unclear at this point if this was due to a mistake I had made in the dose—and I, thus, should have added more colophony to render the oil black—or if colophony was simply the wrong ingredient to use here and I should have chosen a different one instead.</p>
<p><em><strong>Grains of wheat </strong></em></p>
<p>The wheat berries had by far the most unexpected effect on the oil mixture. After having properly mixed in the colophony, I gradually added the grains. Upon contact with the oil, the wheat berries popped, like popcorn, and produced a yellow-golden foam that swiftly rose to the top of the beaker and, after a few seconds and when no more grains were added, slowly descended again (its color darkening in the process of declension). The popped and carbonized grains did not appear to disintegrate, however, but floated in the golden foam layer atop the oil mixture. It might well be that some grains did disintegrate or dissolve in the oil; it was hard to discern.</p>
<p>Intriguingly, and to my surprise, almost immediately after adding the first grains, the oil changed color, no longer looked translucent, and became increasingly more black—probably as a result of carbonized grain particles mixing in with the oil and other ingredients.</p>
<p><em><strong>“When the oil has body, you can remove it from the fire”</strong></em></p>
<p>Even though the author-practitioner says that “when the pitch is well melted &amp; when the oil has body, you can remove it from the fire,” it was difficult to determine when to turn off the hotplate. Especially since the colophony had molten instantly, even before adding the grains, and the consistency of the oil did not appear to have changed much. I let the mixture boil for another few minutes, hoping it would thicken. When after a quarter of an hour there was still no palpable or discernable difference in consistency, and the oil had still not come close to what I considered to mean <em>corps</em> (body)—that is, a syruppy or honey-like as opposed to watery substance—I removed the beaker from the hot plate. Although I could have chosen to let the oil boil longer to see if it would develop more <em>corps</em>, my concern that the moisture in the oil mixture would evaporate too much and I would have little left to work with, made me decide to remove the varnish “from the fire.” Whether or not this was the right way to proceed, I did not know. I then tried the author-practitioner’s knife-test described in the entry “Mastic varnish dry in a half hour” on fol. 97v.</p>

<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Applying varnish to early modern &amp; modern steel - Trial one</p>
<p><strong>A Word on Tools and Materials </strong></p>
<p><strong>The iron </strong></p>
<p>The next step in the process was to apply the varnish to the metal. For this I used pieces of bloomery steel made according to medieval techniques by Richard Furrer and reworked by the professional blacksmith and armorer Jeff Wasson—each of these scraps were polished on one side and unpolished on the other. For comparison, I also used a piece of modern 1040 spring steel. These early modern test plates were left overs from the Greenwhich project. See the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ptV0h0Kwjc&amp;t=471s"><em>Nova documentary</em></a> for more information on this project.</p>

<p><strong>Heat source - “low charcoal fire” </strong></p>
<p>To varnish the metal, the author-practitioners instructs us to “place your iron over a low charcoal fire &amp; apply your varnish with a feather or a brosse.” Before I could do so, however, I first had to decide on two things: what to use as a heat source (i.e. a “low charcoal fire”), and at which temperature to heat my metal.</p>
<p>Because it was not possible to work with a historically authentic charcoal fire, I had to find an alternative to approximate this heat source. This posed two interconnected problems. First, I was unsure as to the meaning of “low charcoal fire.” What exactly constituted ‘fire’? Did it involve flames? If yes, how numerous, high or hot should these be? Moreover, what was meant with “low”; did it refer to the temperature of the charcoal or the flames, or rather to the height at which the heat source ought to be positioned in a room? Adding to the problem was the fact that I had very few options to work with. The blow torch was among the resources available to me. However, I assumed the blue flame of this tool would probably be too hot—keeping the possible meaning of “low” in mind—and chose to work with the hot plate instead. Although I was not sure if this indeed equalled a “low charcoal fire,” I considered it the best possible approximation among the options available to me.</p>
<p>Because the author-practitioner does not inform us when or at which temperature to apply the varnish, I decided I would reverse engineer his instruction “And when you see that [the varnish] no longer smokes, it is done and your varnish is dry,” and reasoned that the metal scraps would perhaps be hot enough, when upon application the varnish would start ‘smoking’. This method inevitably involved a trial-and-error approach.</p>

<h3 id="pm-4"><strong>2019.03.13, 5:00 pm</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> Havemeyer Hall, Chandler 260, Columbia University, NY, NY 10027</p>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Thoughts and reflections</p>
<p><strong>Trial one </strong></p>
<p>To see how the varnish would react to the hot metal, however, I first used one of the (fully-polished) bloomery steel scraps as a test piece. I used pliers to place the steel on a hot plate. After only a few minutes, the metal began to change color, starting with a straw or yellow tint, then turning to purple and ultimately fading into blue. Coloring metal this way (that is, through heat) is a technique described by the author practitioner on fol. 96v as <em>faire passer</em>, nowadays it is referred to as ‘bluing’.<a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Because of the pliers some parts of the metal did not come into full contact with the hot plate and the piece was thus heated unevenly. As a result, the steel’s surface ultimately displayed the entire gamut of colors that one can achieve through heat treatment.</p>
<p>To test if the metal was hot enough and the varnish would produce vapor, I removed the steel scrap from the heat source and let one drop of varnish fall onto the hot metal. It took a couple of times before I could detect any vapor coming off of the varnish, which was at the point where at least parts of the scraps had turned blue I judged the metal hot enough to the apply the varnish, which, according to instructions ought to be done with “a feather or a <em>brosse</em>”. I thus dipped a feather into the varnish and applied it onto the metal by moving it from one side to the other. I made a couple of interesting observations.</p>
<p>First, because the carbonized grains never sank to the bottom of the varnish, and some of them were still sitting atop the oil mixture, I was concerned they would get stuck into feather and problematize the process of applying the varnish smoothly on the metal. Surprisingly though, the weight of the carbonized grains (gravity) pulled them down when I lifted the feather out of the beaker with varnish and made them fall back into the oil mixture. Second, upon dipping my feather into the varnish, the liquid appeared to have solidified somewhat and had turned into a more syruppy or honey-like mixture. Interestingly, however, when I moved the feather across the hot sheet, the varnish liquified slightly, thus facilitating the application process.</p>
<p>Although the heat of the metal allowed for the varnish to liquify, making it easier to apply it, I still struggled to spread the mixture evenly and smoothly across the steel plate. This could either be due the fact that I simply had not gained enough control over the feather—and needed to practice more—or because the varnish had solidified too much and was too thick. Third, the vapor disappeared almost immediately after I had applied the varnish, and even though it had thus “stop[ped] smoking,” it was not <em>seche</em> at all but rather sticky. Moreover, the resulting varnish film was not black, but translucent, irregular and the various colors of the metal were still visible through it.</p>
<p><strong>Trial 2 </strong></p>
<p>I judged this an unsuccessful attempt to produce a black varnish and chose to do another trial with one alteration: instead of keeping the metal removed from the heat source after having applied the varnish, I chose to put it back on the hotplate to see what would happen. Remarkably, there was more vapor coming off of the varnish when I held the metal scrap back over the heat source and the smoking lasted much longer. Most importantly, this small change in the process, had affected the resulting film in a couple of ways. First, the varnish had gradually darkened over the hot plate and the film was no longer translucent and irregular, as the film in the first trial, but had turned into a dark brown and smooth, shiny finish that did not reveal the colored metal underneath. Second, and most excitingly, the varnish was dry. This outcome illustrates how reconstructions allow for a window into the meaning of concepts as they are understood by historical actors. When the author says “it is done and your varnish is dry,” what he means is, it no longer sticks. My reconstruction furthermore afforded proof of concept. Just as the author-practitioner described, the varnish was dry when it stopped smoking. Heat had proven crucial in this process. Not only had it heated the metal (and changed its color), it had darkened the tint of the varnish, and rendered it dry.</p>
<p><strong>Trial two and three</strong></p>
<p>Although this second trial can be considered successful to an important degree and on various levels, the varnish was still not black. I thus chose to make a couple of alterations for my third trial (for which I would use remaining bloomery steel scraps). First, in order to heat the metal evenly on all sides and to try and approximate a black color, I chose not hold the scraps over the heat source with pliers, put place them directly on it. For safety reasons and out of concern the varnish would catch fire when coming into contact with the hot plate, I used a cast iron pan as a mediator. Second, I chose to work with a <em>brosse</em>—which the author-practitioner suggests as an alternative to the feather—hoping this tool would afford me more control over applying the varnish.<a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Although the shape of the metal did not allow the plates to come in full contact with the hot surface of the cast iron pan, removing the pliers did appear to have an effect: the steel scraps seemed to be heating more evenly judging from their color. The color of the varnish on the polished parts of the metal did not seem darker than that of the film in the second trial. The varnish on the unpolished side, however, much more resembled a black color. Yet I could still distinguish it as a deep dark brown, rather than an intense black.</p>
<p>The use of the brush allowed for some interesting experiences. First, while, as aforementioned, the feather problematized applying the varnish, the brush facilitated this process. When I ran the brush over the hot metal, I felt more in control and it was easier to cover parts of the sheet with varnish. Yet, while the brush had noticeably simplified applying the varnish, the resulting film nevertheless showed occasional traces of brush strokes, causing for an irregular finish. Although we do not know what the varnished surface of a period sword guard would have looked like, it seems unlikely that an uneven, patchy finish bearing clear traces of tools or techniques used in the process would have been desirable (both from an aesthetic and a practical point of view). Since the author-practitioner does not comment on this particular part of the process other than by saying one needs to use a feather or <em>brosse</em>, and I only noticed the brush strokes after the varnish had dried, I could only hypothesize at this point about what might have possibly caused these marks or how I should prevent them in future trials. My assumption was that the varnish was still too thick or viscous, and I had not added enough oil or boiled it for too long, thereby rendering it more susceptible to take on an imprint, such as the stroke of a brush.</p>
<p>Although my three trials had been rather successful, I had still not produced a <em>black</em> varnish. One explanation might be that I had not added enough grains Since, unfortunately, it was not possible to reconstruct another varnish, I could not test my hypothesis. Having observed, however, that heat considerably darkened the varnish, one other option would be to increase the temperature or amount of heat applied, for example by using a blow torch. Another possibility was that I should have applied more varnish on the metal, in other words, putting multiple layers on top of each other.</p>
<p><strong>Trials three and four </strong></p>
<p><strong>Varnishing the test plate </strong></p>
<p>Even before the start of my final trial, it was clear that due its shape heating the guard by means of a hot plate would be problematic, if not impossible. Given the crucial role of consistent heat, I chose to work with the blow torch so as to heat all parts of the guard properly. The complex and multidimensional shape of the guard already required a lot more reflection regarding the heating and varnishing process. As in previous trials, I used a flat steel sheet to practice the gestures involved in the process and to explore how the metal and the varnish would respond to the heat of the torch. While I held the piece of metal with pliers, my lab partner Naomi Rosenkranz wielded the blow torch. We aimed the flame at the inside of the metal (that is, the part of the steel that we would not varnish) and waited for the steel to change color. This took significantly less time than with the bloomery steel scraps that I used in my previous trials, which were heated with the hot plate. After only a few seconds (as opposed to minutes with the hot plate), the steel plate turned yellow—a fact that illustrated the big difference in temperature between the flame of a blow torch and the heat coming off of the hot plate. When the metal faded from purple into a blue color, we briefly turned off the blow torch, dipped a brush into the varnish, and—while keeping the blow torch close and ready to be turned on again—ran it across the sheet, as evenly as possible, with a single layer. We then immediately reignited the flame of the torch and aimed it at the unvarnished side of the steel. We noticed a significant increase of vapor coming off of the varnish compared to previous trials. Whether this was due to the thin layer of varnish I had applied or because of the temperature of the torch’s flame, and we had thus used a much more powerful heat source, was not clear. It might well have been a combination of both.</p>
<p>Most excitingly, however, the varnish, only seconds after we had applied it and began reheating the sheet, turned from a yellow-brown, translucent liquid into a dark, opaque and shiny black film. Moreover, whereas in my previous trials, the varnish had liquified but had not run off the sheets when it touched the hot metal; I now had to keep my sheet horizontal at all times because the varnish was so liquid that it begun to drip and run down the metal plate.</p>
<p>Even before the varnish had stopped smoking--indicating it would be dry--bubbles appeared on top of the film and parts of the varnish appeared to be disintegrating. We were not sure if we should have added a thicker layer of varnish, if the heat had caused the varnish to scale off, or perhaps both. While we had certainly succeeded in producing a <em>black</em> varnish, we had failed in creating a lasting one.</p>
<p><strong>Varnishing the Guard</strong></p>
<p>The sword guard I reconstructed consisted of two separately made pieces that were joined together at the center by rivets.These parts were made of two different types of metal of varying degrees of thickness. The clam or shell shape was rather thin (16 gage) made of 1050 modern mild steel, cold-worked (that is, not heat-treated) and unpolished.<a href="#fn9" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The iron cross guard was significantly thicker, heated in a forge several times, and roughly polished. These differences in thickness had important consequences for the heat treatment and varnishing process. Whereas the thin steel clam swiftly turned from golden to blue, it took much longer for the iron cross guard to reach the desired temperature for varnishing—even with the intense heat of the blow torch.</p>
<p>While the thin clam was quickly heated, this caused problems when applying the varnish. Even before it had stopped smoking, the varnish began to blister and scale off and some parts of the clam started to show the metal underneath. Unlike the results of trials one and two, the varnish in this fourth experiment turned black, but its finish was highly irregular and quite rough. In contrast, when I varnished the thick iron bar, its black surface appeared more uniform than that of the clam. According to Jeff Wasson, this might be because thick metal, although taking longer to reach a high temperature, retains heat and cools more slowly, which might have been advantageous to the process of varnishing.<a href="#fn10" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>That solving (or preventing) this problem was a matter of experience and required skill and knowledge of how best to heat metal of varying degrees of thickness, can be shown by comparing the finish of my varnished test plate from trial three with that of the varnished guard (trial four). It was because of my failure in trial three to produce a smooth black surface that I realized I should probably keep the metal plate further away from the heat source, reduce the length of the heating process, and turn off the blow torch perhaps even before the varnish stopped smoking. These insights were what I then tried to put into practice in trial four, when I varnished the guard. Even though the surface of the varnished guard looked less blistered than that of my test plate from trial three, it was still irregular and parts of the varnish had nevertheless been burned off.</p>
<p>Even before the start of my final reconstruction, it was clear that it would be problematic, if not impossible, to heat and varnish the various surface areas of this complex structure simultaneously and evenly—a factor which had proven key to producing a smooth black finish. One of the questions this process thus raised was how artisans would have heated their sword guards “over a low charcoal fire.”</p>
<p>The use of tongs, although theoretically possible, proved problematic: the weight of the guard made it difficult to hold at a specific angle; gravity kept pulling it down, making it harder to heat the metal evenly and effectively. While I ultimately managed to heat and varnish half of the guard (one side of the clam and one side of the cross bar) by locking it into place with a clamp, this process still required tremendous control over my wrist and arm—and thus bodily strength and dexterity—to hold up the guard and facilitate the heating process.</p>
