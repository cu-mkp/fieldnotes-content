<p>Procedure: A piece of copper was punctured in two places using an Olfa craft knife. A piece of cotton string (manufacturer unknown) was threaded through the holes in the copper. The copper was then suspended over about 30 mL of 5% Bragg’s Apple Cider Vinegar (with the mother) in a clean glass mason jar. The lid of the jar was closed over the string to secure it in place. The jar was then placed in a closet near a hot water pipe to emulate the warm, moist environments described in resources.</p>
<p>Additional notes: The copper was punctured rather than folded over the string to maximize the possible surface area for verdigris growth.</p>

<p>The copper was observed to have begun to grow verdigris. The verdigris was dark teal in color and covered nearly the entirety of the copper surface.</p>

<p>The copper and verdigris were observed. The verdigris appeared to be receding or becoming corrupted (see dark color below), though without precise measuring devices it was impossible to determine this with any certainty. The copper was removed from the jar, and the amount of vinegar was reduced to about 10 mL. The jar was resealed over the copper and verdigris and returned to the same place in the closet.</p>

<p>The copper and verdigris were observed. The verdigris appeared to be ‘crystallizing,’ or forming ‘sparkly growths.’ See photo for examples of this.</p>

<p>The copper and verdigris were removed from the jar for observation (see photos attached). Verdigris appeared to have grown on the string attached to the copper as well (see below).</p>

<p>I photographed the verdigris, which has been suspended in the jar over vinegar, again today. After taking the photograph below, I suspended the copper in the jar again. The verdigris has not changed much, but the vinegar is turning slightly green. Why might this be happening? Pamela suggests that this might be occurring because the verdigris is dripping into the vinegar. This is consistent with my observations of the verdigris forming in ‘droplets’ on the copper.</p>
