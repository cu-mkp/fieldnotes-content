<p>I began by mixing 50 grams of yeast, 50 grams of water, and 50 grams of flour in a glass jar. I then mixed the contents of the jar thoroughly and placed the jar in a warm room to let it culture.</p>

<p><strong>Subject: Bread Mold Making</strong></p>
<p>After letting the bread cool, I cut off several slices in order to make for two molds. For the two-piece mold, I cut off two slices and pressed a key into one of them, leaving it in place for several minutes. For the other mold, I pushed a different key through a slice of bread until it penetrated through the other side, leaving a key-shaped hole in the bread.</p>
<p>In order to adapt this recipe, I first had to bake bread. As the Manuscript does not supply a particular recipe, I used a modern one for the sake of simplicity. Nevertheless, the bread fresh out of the oven had the doughy consistency that the author seems to have had in mind. After baking the bread, one of the recipes calls for placing the object to be molded into the bread and letting it dry. Having done this, it seems to have worked well, as a clear outline of the key is visible in the piece of bread used for this purpose. For the recipe for shrinking a larger figure, the author seems to have had in mind one piece of bread in which the imprint of the object to be molded creates a hole that completely penetrates the bread. Although the author does not describe how exactly one ought to do this, I simply pushed the key that I had chosen through the fresh bread until I had created a hole in the shape of the key.</p>

<p>For this portion of the experiment, I brought two molds to the lab. For the first mold, as shown in the entry above, I entirely removed the pith around the key that I had chosen to mold. For the second mold, I merely left an indentation in the bread in the shape of the key I wished to mold. I began the molding process using beeswax with the first mold. After completely melting the beeswax, my lab partner held the bread down on a plate as I poured the wax. Some wax did leak out from the bread, but the majority of it remained in place. After allowing the beeswax to dry, I returned to break the mold out of the bread at 2:00 pm. The mold had become attached to the plate and it was rather difficult to remove all of the bread. Ultimately, the mold was only vaguely shaped like the key on which it was modeled, and it broke in have while the bread was being removed.</p>
<p>For the second mold, I employed sulfur. Beforehand, however, I had painted the indentation in the bread with linseed oil. I then poured the sulfur into the mold, but was unable to examine the results before the end of the lab session.</p>

<p>Returning to the molding experiment, I began to break my sulfur mold out of the bread. I first noticed that the sulfur had filled the indentation in the bread with a great deal of consistency, and as I began to remove the mold from the bread, I noticed that the process was much easier than it had been with the mold using beeswax. The linseed oil that I had used to paint this mold might also have played a role in this. Upon removing the mold, I noticed that it contained a surprising amount of detail, including the teeth and various indentations on the key. It also included a representation of the three holes at the base of the key.</p>
