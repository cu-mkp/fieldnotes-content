<p>I fed the starter for the first time with water and flour. I used a measuring cup and used 1 part starter, 1 part water and 2 part flour. I repeated the process 2 more times at 12 hrs intervals</p>

<p>I bought the materials I needed for the modern recipe of making sourdough bread. I got white enriched flour as the flour differently than the fine flour indicated in the manuscript.</p>

<p><strong>Subject: Baking Bread</strong></p>
<p>1-I first added the flour and the water to the starter. I used volume as opposed to weight. The recipe indicated ⅓ each. It took some time to find the right consistency, experimenting with different amounts. Feeling that it was too watery was the source of the anxiety</p>
<p>2-At this point, I added yeast to the mix to make sure I had something that I could work with at the end of the day.</p>
<p>3-After that, I kneaded the dough for about 20 minutes.</p>
<p>4-Following that, I baked the bread in the oven for about 4 hrs.</p>
<p>5-Right before putting the bread in the oven, I stuck one of my objects on the dough to see whether I could get an impression before baking the bread.</p>
<p>6-After the baking was done, I found out that the impression was retained but baked bread had created its own texture of bubbles on the top. The sides though gave me a clear, straight edge, something I was wondering how would work with the inside of the break, right after baking while hot and soft.</p>
<p>7-Next, I took the inside of the bread, a 6”x6” piece, impressed upon it the tool and the crystal that I was making a mold of.</p>

<p><strong>Name:</strong> Baris Gokturk with Olivia Branscum</p>
<p><strong>Date and Time:</strong></p>
<h3 id="pm-3"><strong>2018.10.01, 01:30 pm</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Location: Chandler 260</strong></p>
<p><strong>Subject: Bread Molding</strong></p>
<p>I worked with Olivia in the lab, taking turns in taking photos of our respective molds. I proceeded with the 3 molds I had prepared, a wrench and a piece of calcite (twice) , both one-part molds.</p>
<p>Based on past studio experience working with molds and knowing the need for release agents in different scenarios, I took the option of coating the molds with linseed oil before pouring.</p>
<p>When choosing between sulfur or beeswax to cast, I found myself attracted to beeswax option because I could visualize more or less what it would look like. I was attracted to sulfur for the opposite reason, that I couldn’t quite feel the end result even after looking at past work. For this reason, I chose the ranch to be done in beeswax, a safe choice, and the calcite in both since I had two pieces of that. One of the two calcite mols was created before baking the bread against the recipe and one right after the baking in accordance with the recipe.</p>
<p>We first did the wax pouring. We heated up the wax and as one of us held it, we poured it into the mold. A few ideas came up. One was to balance to mold (in the event one was by themselves) by using the outside crumb of the bread as a mother-mold. The other was to use clay to do the same thing. We also used clay to plug some holes in the bread. Once pouring the wax, it was clear that there would be holes inside the bread, invisible to us, telling from some leakage we had on the plate.</p>
<p>For the sulfur, we placed the molds in the sand and propped them up. While under the fume hood, I poured the sulfur into the relatively simple cubical mold of the calcite. After the cooling period of 20 minutes, the cast object came easily out of the mold. Thus I ended up with 3 cast objects.</p>
