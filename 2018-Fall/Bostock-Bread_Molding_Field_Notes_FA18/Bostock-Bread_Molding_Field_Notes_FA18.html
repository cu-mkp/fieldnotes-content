<p><strong>Subject: Storing the sourdough starter</strong></p>
<p>I received a sourdough starter from the project team.</p>
<p>As soon as I arrived home I put it in the fridge.</p>
<p>It took about a half an hour from the time I received it = until I placed it in the refrigerator.</p>

<p>Ingredients:</p>
<p>1 cup of sourdough starter</p>
<p>1 ½ cup of water</p>
<p>4 ¼ cups of white wheat flour</p>
<p>1 ½ tablespoon of salt</p>
<p>Tools:</p>
<p>Measuring cups</p>
<p>1 plastic bowl</p>
<p>2 baking pans</p>
<p>I added the ingredients to the bowl and mixed them one by one according to the order above.</p>
<p>I kneaded/folded the dough until it was smooth and uniform(?)</p>
<p>I wrapped the bowl with a plastic bag and let the dough rise for 1 ½ hours.</p>
<p>I spread flour on the baking pans.</p>
<p>I folded the dough again and shaped 3 round rolls, and placed them on a baking pan.</p>
<p>I covered the pan with a towel and let it rise for 4 more hours.</p>
<p>I folded again each of the 3 pieces of dough, placed one in a smaller baking pan, and the two others in the big pan. I let it rise again.</p>
<p>At 12am I punched the dough a little to let the air out, wrapped the pans with plastic bags and placed them all in the fridge for the night.</p>

<p>I took the baking pans out of the fridge, took off the plastic bag, let it rise a little bit.</p>
<p>I cut a few lines on the top of the dough and spread a little flour on the top.</p>
<p>I turned on the oven, on 500 degrees F.</p>
<p>I baked the pan with the 2 loaves</p>
<p>15 minutes on 500 F</p>
<p>Then turned it to 425 F</p>
<p>And baked for another 30 minutes.</p>

<p><strong>Subject: Deciphering the recipe from Ms. Fr. 640</strong></p>
<p>I used the updated version from the BnF Ms Fr 640 folder in the google drive.</p>
<p>Page 140v.</p>
<p>&lt;head&gt;For casting in &lt;m&gt;sulfur&lt;/m&gt;&lt;/head&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;ab&gt;</p>
<p>To cast neatly in &lt;m&gt;sulfur&lt;/m&gt;, arrange the &lt;m&gt;bread pith&lt;/m&gt; under the &lt;tl&gt;brazier&lt;/tl&gt;, as you know. Mold in it what you want &amp;amp; let dry &amp;amp; you will have very neat work.&lt;/ab&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;ab&gt;<br />
&lt;margin&gt;left-middle&lt;/margin&gt;<br />
Try &lt;m&gt;sulfur&lt;/m&gt; passed through &lt;m&gt;melted wax&lt;/m&gt;, because it no longer inflames &amp;amp; and no longer makes eyelets.&lt;/ab&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;/div&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;div&gt;<br />
&lt;id&gt;p140v_2&lt;/id&gt;<br />
&lt;head&gt;Molding and shrinking a large figure&lt;/head&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;ab&gt;</p>
<p>Mold it with &lt;m&gt;bread pith&lt;/m&gt;, having come from the &lt;tl&gt;oven&lt;/tl&gt;, or as the above, &amp;amp; in drying out it will shrink &amp;amp; consequently the medal that you will cast. You &lt;del&gt;it&lt;/del&gt; can, by this means, by elongating and widening the imprinted &lt;m&gt;bread pith&lt;/m&gt;, vary the figure &amp;amp; with one image make many various ones. &lt;m&gt;Bread&lt;/m&gt; coming from the &lt;tl&gt;oven&lt;/tl&gt; is better. And the one that is reheated twice retracts more. You can cast &lt;m&gt;sulphur&lt;/m&gt; without leaving the imprint of the &lt;m&gt;bread&lt;/m&gt; to dry, if you want to mold as big as it is. But if you want to let it shrink, make it dry, either more or less.&lt;/ab&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;/div&gt;</p>
<p>My interpretation:</p>
<p>To create the mold - take the bread as soon as it comes out of the oven, slice it, and press the figure / medal / object into it.</p>
<p>If you want the size to be the same as the original, don’t wait for it to dry, cast the sulphur immediately. If you want it to shrink, let the bread dry first.</p>

<p><strong>Subject: Making the Mold</strong></p>
<p>I took the pan out of the oven and placed it on the stove.</p>
<p>Immediately I took one of the loaves, placed it on a cutting board and sliced it.</p>
<p>I pressed 3 objects into 3 pieces of bread: my wedding ring, a clothes peg, a key.</p>
<p>I let the bread cool with the objects inside.</p>

<p><strong>Subject: Taking the objects out of the mold</strong></p>
<p>I took out the wedding ring and the key.</p>
<p>An interesting difference:</p>
<p>The wedding ring came out easily, clean, the only thing that was left is the impression of the ring. The ring is made of gold.</p>
<p>The key was a little harder to take out. It left a green mark (maybe verdigris?).</p>
<p>Perhaps the type of metal influences the interaction with the bread.</p>
<p>The key itself also has different marks on it now.</p>
<p>The bread is hard and dry. It looks like a good mold.</p>

<p><strong>Location: Lab</strong></p>
<p><strong>Subject: Casting to the bread mold</strong></p>
<p>1:15 approximately - Min brushed her staple mold with linseed oil. Nicolle brushed her jar mold with linseed oil. (Did Min brush her key mold as well? Must ask her)</p>
<p>1:20 - I brushed the ring mold with linseed oil (in order to help the final product separate easier from the bread). I didn’t brush the key mold in order to see the difference.</p>
<p>1:27 - we melted beeswax</p>
<p>1:31 - we added some more wax to the pot because we thought it wouldn’t be enough for all 3 molds</p>
<p>1:34 - the wax was ready</p>
<p>1:36 - poured wax into Min’s key mold</p>
<p>1:38 - poured wax into my ring mold.</p>
<p>1:39 - poured wax into Min’s one-part staple mold.</p>
<p>Min taped her two-parts staple mold with masking tape. She poured wax into it (time N/A).</p>
<p>Nicolle taped her two-parts jar mold with masking tape and positioned it on a tape roll to make it vertical. She melted wax and poured it into the jar mold at 2:03.</p>
<p>I placed my key mold on a plate in the fume hood horizontally, to keep the key as flat as possible.</p>
<p>1:54 - I poured sulfur into my key mold.</p>
<p>The bread mold had holes and the sulfur dripped through the bread to the plate underneath. Not a lot of sulfur filled the key mold itself.</p>
<p>Min poured sulfur to another mold.</p>
<p>We put all molds with castings to dry.</p>

<p><strong>Subject: Dismantling the bread mold</strong></p>
<p>After 3 days in the lab, the bread was so hard I couldn’t break it with my hands.</p>
<p>I had to use a knife and scissors to cut it and break it.</p>
<p>I soaked the ring mold in water to soften the bread, because it was with beeswax so I thought there would be no problem.</p>
<p>I didn’t want to mix sulfur with water so I kept trying to break the key mold with my hands.</p>
<p>The water helped to remove most of the bread easily from the ring mold.</p>
<p>Now I had to take off all the little crumbs that stuck to it.</p>
<p>It doesn’t seem that the linseed oil helped that much to make the removing process easier.</p>
<p>I used a toothpick to remove the breadcrumbs. I had to be careful to make sure I don’t hurt the wax when I use it. I tried to use a toothbrush but the toothpick was more beneficial.</p>
<p>The final result - it seems that the ring mold wasn’t very accurate. The part that came out most similarly to the original is the edge of the ring, which was pressed to the bottom of the mold. Probably the process of pressing the ring into the bread made the bottom of it most dominant because of the pressure, but also might have erased the gentle lines in the sides of the ring. One could recognize some diagonal lines on the outer perimeter of the molded ring, but I’m not sure if it’s just a coincidence or because of the mold. Perhaps the bread did catch the gentle decoration lines, but because the bread cooled before I cast the wax in it, the mold was distorted, expanded or shrank.</p>
<p>I didn’t manage to take the bread off the molded key. The bread absorbed most of the sulfur and only a very thin layer stayed on the key mold. Eventually I broke the key with the bread.</p>
