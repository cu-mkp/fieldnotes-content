<p>Because the recipe specifies using “well-gummed ink,” I decided to test out three different kinds of ink in my reconstruction to see if the kind of ink in fact made a difference.</p>
<p>First Ink:</p>
<p>Lampblack Ink (Standard ink recipe and proportions from <em>Carbon ink info and recipes</em> (adapted from Columbia Ancient Ink Lab) with 10:1 ratio of water:gum)</p>
<p>Step One:</p>
<p>In a beaker, mix together the following ingredients:</p>
<p>2g gum arabic</p>
<p>20g water</p>
<p>The gum does not easily mix with the water, so I alternated between mixing and allowing the blobs of gum arabic to soak in the water until the gum was fully dissolved.</p>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Step Two:</p>
<p>Measure the mass of the gum and water mixture. Because it was 20.3g total (I had transferred it to a new beaker and had lost some liquid in the process) and I needed a 9:1 ratio of gummed water:lampblack, I mixed in 2.26g of lampblack until fully incorporated.</p>

<p>Second Ink:</p>
<p>Lampblack Ink with Double the Gum (10:2 ratio of water:gum arabic)</p>
<p>Step One:</p>
<p>Mix together 4g of gum arabic with 20g of water. The process was largely the same as above, but the gum water was notably thicker and more viscous.</p>

</table>
<p>Step Two:</p>
<p>Mass of the gum water was 22.3g so using the same 9:1 ratio of gum water:lampblack, I added 2.47g of lampblack to the gum water and mixed until fully incorporated.</p>

<p>Both of the inks are dark black and very runny, especially compared to the kind of ink used in printing, which is oil based and incredibly thick. I was curious about how the runniness of the ink would affect its ability to be stamped across onto another piece of paper.</p>
<p>For the third ink, I had decided to use iron gall ink prepared by Naomi Rosenkranz.</p>

<p>With my three inks, as prepared above, I began testing the recipe for writing as well from the left as from the right. I had interpreted the general flow of the recipe as follows.</p>
<p>Step 1: Take paper and cut into small squares</p>
<p>Step 2: Write a letter on the small square of paper</p>
<p>Step 3: Place square of paper ink side down onto larger piece of paper</p>
<p>Step 4: While holding the square in place, rub over the top with a burnisher</p>
<p>Step 5: Letter is stamped onto the larger piece of paper as a mirror image</p>
<p>For my first attempt, I used multi-media paper instead of the historical paper. I practiced writing with a quill and was surprised how much ink the quill deposited on the paper. There was a noticeable pile of ink for each letter that I wrote.</p>

<p>After practicing for a while, I cut a piece of the multimedia paper into small squares and wrote the letter “a” on a card using the 10:1 lampblack ink. I then flipped it over onto a second sheet of multimedia paper, held it in place with the tip of my finger, and rubbed it with a burnisher. When I removed the small square of paper, I found that the ink had splotched. While the pattern on the small square was the same as the pattern on the sheet of paper (as mirror images, of course), they did not resemble the letter “a” at all.</p>

<p>I repeated this a few more times with the other inks on the multimedia paper to see if the other inks worked better (I was particularly curious about whether the more well-gummed 10:2 lampblack ink would hold the shape of the letter better), but the splotching continued. I was concerned that it was perhaps the multimedia paper that was the problem, seeing as it didn’t appear to absorb any of the ink at all, so I switched to newsprint paper and attempted the same thing with all three kinds of ink. The letters were still splotching.</p>

<p>Still, because I was running out of time, I tried the technique a couple of times on the sized historical paper before cleaning up and leaving the lab. The letters were still very splotchy and illegible.</p>

<p>This time around, I started playing around with the amount of ink the quills were depositing onto the paper, beginning first on newsprint paper. The quills were all fairly worn (the tips were spreading apart a lot whenever I pressed them against the paper), but I found one that was sturdier than the others and found that if I didn’t use the quill immediately after dipping it into the ink but wrote on some scratch paper to use up some of the ink before writing “a” onto the small card, there was much less ink making up each letter and they began to transfer much better.</p>

<p>After a while doing this with the newsprint, I switched over to the sized historical paper. I did it a couple of times with the feather quills, but by this point had worn out even the best quill I had, so I switched over to a quill that had been made using a metal fountain pen nib. Though not as historically accurate, this nib was much easier for me to control than the old and worn out feather quills, and my letters started looking very legible when transferred as mirror images onto the larger piece of paper.</p>

<p>I suspect that the author-practitioner, as someone who wrote with quills regularly, was much better at using a quill than I, as someone who had only started writing with one a couple days earlier, was, and that he therefore would have had a much better control over the amount of ink he deposited on the paper when writing. Based on my experiments with the three different kinds of ink, I found no noticeable difference between them in terms of their ability to be stamped across onto another piece of paper. Instead, my reconstruction really emphasized that it was the amount of ink used to write the letter than made the difference between the recipe working to create a legible mirror image of a letter and making a splotchy mess (when too much ink was used) or nothing at all (when not enough ink was used.</p>
