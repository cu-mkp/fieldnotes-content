<p><strong>Location:</strong> Personal Apartment Kitchen</p>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Bread-making Attempt #1 (Autolysation + Feeding Sourdough)</p>
<p>Weather: Cloudy, 19°C</p>
<p>Humidity: 80%</p>
<p><em>Aims:</em></p>
<p>To test behaviour of sourdough starter by making two loaves of bread using an identical recipe — one with the given starter, and one with a personal starter. Recipe used is not a historical reconstruction, but one I’m familiar with to reduce procedural error.</p>
<p><em>Materials:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>40g Sourdough starter #1 (composition unknown - received in class)</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>40g Sourdough starter #2 (Initial: King Arthur Flour (KAF) Whole Wheat Flour; fed with KAF All-Purpose Flour)</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>300g KAF White Whole Wheat Flour</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>440g KAF All-Purpose (AP) Flour</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>652g Tap water (lukewarm)</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Cling film</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Redman electronic measuring scale (to nearest whole number)</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Redman stainless steel bowl</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Redman silicone heat-resistant spatula</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Procedure:</em></p>
<p><strong>5:55am:</strong> 512g of lukewarm tap water is added to a mixture of 50% KAF Whole Wheat Flour (300g) and 50% AP Flour (300g).</p>

<p>Weather: Cloudy, 22°C</p>
<p>Humidity: 68%</p>
<p><em>Materials:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>2 plastic 1.25-quart containers with lid, 5.47 inches (H) x 6.19 inches (W) x 6.19 inches (D) (Ziploc, medium square)</p>

<li><blockquote>
<p>40g Sourdough starter #2</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>10g Coarse mediterranean sea salt (ground)</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Procedure:</em></p>
<p><strong>10:30am</strong>: Mixture is divided into two and separated into two bowls. 40g of starter #1 is added to one bowl, and 40g of starter #2 is added to the other. Dough is then worked at until starter is fully incorporated.</p>
<p>5g of salt is added into each dough, and worked until fully combined (when fingers can no longer feel any salt granules in the dough - see pictures for technique).</p>
<p>Dough is transferred into separate containers for first proof.</p>
<p><strong>11:00am:</strong> Dough is stretched and folded 8 times (see video for technique). This is repeated 4 times in 30-minute intervals.</p>

Despite dusting both containers with flour, dough #2 still adhered to the container when tipped out, resulting in some spreading. Both doughs were baked in oven for 45 minutes, until deep-brown and hollow when their bottoms are tapped.</p>
<p><strong>11:45pm:</strong> Both loaves taken out of the oven with similar rise and caramelization of crust. Crumb structure of #1 was tighter than #2, but with similar flavour - likely affected by placement of the dough in the oven (#2 placed towards the inside of the oven had a more open crumb).</p>

<p><em>Aims:</em></p>
  <p>To historically reconstruct a loaf using a 17th century sourdough bread recipe. Recipe taken from <a href="http://fieldnotes.makingandknowing.org/2018-Fall/Assis-Bread_Molding_Field_Notes/Fieldnotes-FA18-UllmanJohnEvelynBreadRecipesTranscription.html"><em>Ullman - John Evelyn Bread Recipes Transcription</em></a> with volumes and ratios referenced from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q8kNsc3iv8"><em>Jas Townsends and Sons</em></a>.</p>
<p><em>Materials:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Redman stainless steel bowl</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>1 plastic 1.25-quart containers with lid, 5.47 inches (H) x 6.19 inches (W) x 6.19 inches (D) (Ziploc, medium square)</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>350g KAF Unbleached Bread Flour</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>80g KAF White Whole Wheat Flour</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>40g Sourdough starter #1</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>320g warm water</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>6g Coarse mediterranean sea salt (ground)</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Notes:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Because it was cold, rainy, and humid today, I anticipate to reduce the amount of water used in dough, and to increase fermenting and proofing time.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>I will also use slightly warmer water (~40°C) to feed my starter and incorporate into dough to kickstart starter growth</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Measurements included above are personal estimations of the quantities of each ingredient, as Evelyn does not mention this in his recipe. I based my measurements off Townsends’ video and approximating % hydration of dough</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>I knew I wanted to make a medium-sized bread, so 300-360g of flour (in total) would be sufficient. I wanted a mix of bread flour and whole wheat, to replicate the presence of bran and quality of flour in the 18th century.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Given that Evelyn calls for the dough to be kneaded, the hydration level (percentage of water) in the dough should not be too high (65-70%), unlike modern sourdough (80-90%). I initially added ¾ cups of water, but found the dough slightly tight when kneading (which would’ve impacted its rise), and added another ¼ cups more until dough was sufficiently slack (but still maintained its structure)</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Based off initial experiments (see Bread-making attempt #1), I found that 36-40g of starter was sufficient for getting a good rise in a medium loaf.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Based off these measurements, I then added 5% (~6g) of salt into the dough for flavour.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>**A brief note on conversions and percentages:</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>To calculate % hydration (amount of water in dough)</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Divide weight of water by weight of flour (exclude starter, since starter is equal parts flour and water, and salt is relatively neglibible)</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p><em>Eg. for recipe above</em>: amount of water = <em>250g</em>, amount of flour = 280g (bread flour) + 80g (whole wheat) = <em>360g</em></p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>% Hydration = 250/360 = <em>69%</em></p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>To calculate % salt (amount of salt in dough)</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Divide salt by weight of flour + water</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Usually aiming for 5-8% salt</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Procedure:</em></p>
<p><strong>9:30am:</strong> Sourdough starter taken out from fridge. 70g of KAF bread flour and 70g of warm water added to the starter and stirred until smooth. Starter left on kitchen counter for 4 hours before use.</p>
<p><strong>1:30pm:</strong> Starter had risen nearly twice the height of its original, with many small bubbles on the surface.</p>

<p>Household bread, the more the quantity of wheate, the better: yet it is a good sort of bread for servants, wh. is made of 4 pairs of course-corn &amp; one of Barley, this is a competent proportion for one batch; <em>[1 word illeg]</em> it through the course <em>[1 word illeg]</em>.</p>
<p>[Page 2]</p>
<p>Of this take a Bushell about ten o’clock at night, and put Levin into it covering it with some of the same meale.</p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>‘Levin’ = Levain = Raising agent. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leC_cCs4i5w"><em>This resource from Townsends is a useful guide to leaven.</em></a> Based on research, this could mean barm, yeast, sourdough starter, etc. I will thus be using the given sourdough starter/</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Quantity of flour given here is likely variable depending on amount of bread baked. The purpose of this step seems to just be to activate the starter</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Take a portion of the flour used to bake the bread and add levain into it.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<p>To temper it in winter, make the water as hot as you can indure it w<em>[</em>i<em>]</em>th the hand; In summer, it is sufficient it be luke-warme; so proportionately in the spring, &amp; autumn.</p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Given that starter is made of yeast/bacteria - a living organism - its activity is dependent on the temperature of the environment. (Approx 37°C)</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Since human body temperature is around 37°C, ‘as hot as you can endure it with the hand’ would mean that the water temperature is slightly hotter but around that range</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Colder environment = warmer water to kickstart starter activity, and vice versa</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<p>The next morning early, Levin the rest of the meale, tempering &amp; kneading it a very long time, until it be pretty stiff, for though the softer, more light &amp; more bulky it appeare; yet it will be lesser tasting; the light bread goes faster away than that which is wrought <em>[</em>close<em>]</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Add the levain to the rest of the flour (and water?).</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Based off this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q8kNsc3iv8&amp;t=1s"><em>video</em></a>, the levain is dissolved in water. So I’d imagine mixing the levain in with the flour and combining it with water to make a dough, though not explicitly mentioned</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.pannacooking.com/tips/how-to-temper-dough/"><em>‘Tempering the dough’</em></a>? Tempering AND kneading ‘until it be pretty stiff’ - This step is likely to develop the gluten structure in the dough, and to work the dough as much as you can until that happens (both tempering - hitting the dough, and kneading it)</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p><strong>Visual markers:</strong> It will appear “softer” (not as sticky/shaggy), “more light and more bulky” (not as dense-looking, though more compact)</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>‘The light bread goes faster away than that which is wrought’ - not sure what this means</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<p>The bread well kneaded, you shall <em>[</em>turne<em>]</em> it in the Trough, laing the bottom upmost; then thrust your fist in the middle of the dow to the very bottom of the trough in 2 or 3 places, then cover it well with meale sacks &amp; clean blankets.</p>
<p>Having let it stand there for a while (longer in winter than summer) &amp; <em>[</em>until<em>]</em> you find those holes closed or swelled up; the rising is perfect;</p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Leave the bread to proof</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p><strong>Visual markers:</strong> ‘thrust your fist in the middle of the dow’... ‘until holes closed or swelled up’ - how to tell when the proofing is ready (rather than the conventional way of proofing until doubled in size)</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<p>therefore now let somebody be heating of the oven (for it is impossible one person should send both) while you cut the <em>[</em>masse<em>]</em> in pieces; the pieces may be of 16 pound weight each, or some what more; than mould &amp; forme it with loaves, which lay on a cleaned layered cloth, so as a fold of the linen may part and keepe them from inter touching.</p>

<p><strong>Recipe for bread mold in the manuscript: </strong></p>
<p>Molding and shrinking a large figure</p>
<p>Mold it with bread pith, having come from the oven, or as the above, &amp; in drying out it will shrink &amp; consequently the medal that you will cast. You can, by this means, by elongating and widening the imprinted bread pith, vary the figure with one image make many various ones. Bread coming from the oven is better. And the one that is reheated twice retracts more. You can cast sulphur without leaving the imprint of the bread to dry, if you want to mold as big as it is. But if you want to let it shrink, make it dry, either more or less.</p>
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><blockquote>
<p>Mold must be done straight from the oven while bread is hot.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>The hotter and more moist the bread, the better it is to imprint.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Reheating the bread (after or before the imprint?) shrinks the imprint.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Drying the bread out shrinks the imprint.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Imprint on bread can be adjusted to make several variations of the same mold.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><blockquote>
<p>Does the crumb structure/how big the holes are affect the details of the mold?</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>“Bread coming from the oven is better” -- would molding work if bread is cooled?</p>

<p><em>Bread baking</em></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><blockquote>
<p>Feed sourdough starter with equal parts flour and water until active bubbling (overnight)</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>The next day, measure out 40g sourdough starter and set it aside.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Measure out 280g bread flour, 80g whole wheat flour, 250g water (temperature dependent on surroundings - see annotations above) and 5g salt into a bowl. Add sourdough starter. Mix until a loose, shaggy dough forms.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Tip contents onto counter and gather the dough into a ball. Knead for 10-15 minutes until surface is smooth and springy to touch.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Transfer dough to container to proof. Poke 2-3 holes through the dough. Once the holes have closed up, the proofing is complete.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>After proofing is complete, pre-heat oven to hottest setting (in my case, 525F) with oven racks placed at the bottomest part of the oven. Place a baking tray on the top rack and a sheet pan on the bottom. Fill sheet pan with boiling hot water. Close the oven.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Tip dough out of container, and shape it into a ball. Transfer dough to proofing basket/container (in a similar shape to the eventual bread loaf) and leave it to proof until oven is sufficiently heated (1-2 hours)</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Take baking tray out of oven and transfer dough onto baking tray. Score the dough and leave it to bake for 20 mins at 525F before lowering the temperature to 475F, baking for another 20 mins (approx). Bread is done when surface is browned and insides sound hollow when crust is rapped with knuckle.</p>

<p><em>Procedure:</em></p>
<p><strong>11:00pm</strong> <strong>(night before):</strong> Sourdough starter taken out of refrigerator. 70g bread flour and 70g warm water added to starter, then stirred till completely mixed. Starter left to stand at room temperature on kitchen rack, with lid loosely screwed.</p>
<p><strong>7:00am:</strong> Sourdough starter has doubled in volume. Starter was stirred down with silicone spatula, and 40g of it was portioned out and set aside. In a mixing bowl, I measured out 280g of bread flour, 80g whole wheat flour, 250g water and 6g salt. I added the 40g of starter into the bowl, and stirred (with my fingers) until a loose dough formed.</p>

Perhaps not pressed in hard enough? Or perhaps the stapler was too thick? Will make another batch to test with the stapler and another object.</p>

<p><em>Notes and Thoughts:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>There seems to be a limit to the size and shape of the object that can be molded. Smaller objects (such as the key and nail) were much easily embedded in the loaf, while larger objects faced more difficulty.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Will have to test out later in the lab if the details (eg. grooves of the nail) can be captured by the bread mold.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>I believe that the crumb structure of the loaf does affect the outcome of the mold. An open crumb would mean more air pockets and thinner gluten strands. For instance, for the stapler, this meant that when force was applied to push the stapler into the mold, the gluten strands from other parts of the bread gave way. It was thus difficult for the stapler to fully adhere to the loaf.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>In this case, instead of preserving the air pockets from the first proof, might be wiser to knock all the air out to produce a tighter crumb.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>This could also be due to the ratios of the surface area of the object to the bread loaf itself. Smaller objects = smaller surface area = larger ratio. Thus when force is applied, a greater pressure was exerted and object could be easily embedded into the loaf. You can see this with the stapler as well, where thinner areas (with smaller surface areas) embedded well into the loaf compared to its thicker portions.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>In such instances, maybe the one-sided mold would not be as effective as pressing two loaves together onto the object, as the depth of the mold can be halved on each side of the loaf to achieve a same effect</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>The shrinkage of the loaf after it has cooled was interesting, and gave context and insight as to what the manuscript meant by “if you want to let it shrink, make it dry, either more or less.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>The change of colour of the mold with the key was interesting as well. I wonder if this will affect the eventual colour of the wax/sulphur cast onto the mold.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>There was definitely more to the application of the object to the loaf than I expected, and will have to expand on the details in my revised protocol.</p>

<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Casting Bread Molds</p>
<p><em>Aims:</em></p>
<p>To fill my three molds with beeswax or sulphur to produce replica of object and determine success of creating the bread molds</p>
<p><em>Materials:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Bread mold #1 (Stapler)</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Bread mold #2 (Nail)</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>

</ul>
<p><em>Initial Thoughts:</em></p>
<p>I had some options of how to cast my mold. With a choice of:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><blockquote>
<p>Brushing surface of the mold with linseed oil</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Not brushing surface of the mold with linseed oil</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ol>
<p>And</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><blockquote>
<p>Filling interior of the mold with sulphur</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Filling interior of the mold with beeswax</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ol>
<p>This means that there were 4 different ways to cast my bread molds. Since linseed oil was to prevent the sulphur/wax from adhering to the bread, I decided to brush bread molds #1 and #2 with the oil, as they had more detailed grooves which would’ve increased the chances of the mold sticking.</p>
<p>I decided to fill #1 and #3 with beeswax. Especially with 1, since the impressions were quite irregular (some very shallow), potential leakages would be less dangerous with beeswax than sulphur. I chose to fill #2 with sulphur since the nail left the most impression on the bread, and the mold was small enough to be easily handled.</p>
<p>For bread mold #4, I was initially not planning to use it, given the shallowness of its impression and the huge gaps when the two pieces of bread were pressed together. I thus did not brush it with linseed oil, but decided to fill it with beeswax as it was the less dangerous choice.</p>
<p>This would allow me to test out as many permutations of bread mold casting as I could.</p>
<p>In sum:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><blockquote>
<p>Bread mold #1 (Stapler): Linseed oil, Beeswax</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Bread mold #2 (Nail): Linseed oil, Sulphur</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Bread mold #3 (Key): Beeswax</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Bread mold #4 (Stapler, 2-piece): Beeswax</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ol>
<p><em>Procedure:</em></p>
<p><strong>1:15pm:</strong> I brushed molds #1 and #2 with linseed oil, making sure to coat the molds thoroughly, brushing over the grooves and small details multiple times. Especially for the stapler mold, I notice the linseed oil soaking into some of the larger air pockets in the crumb.</p>

<p>It was difficult to judge the amount of beeswax needed, especially for larger molds, since we were unsure how much of the wax would flow into the air pockets instead. We used ~a quarter of the can provided. This was melted under medium heat.</p>

<p><strong>1:48pm:</strong> Prepared bread mold #4 for casting. With the help of the M&amp;K team, I first molded clay to plug the gaps in my bread mold and prevent leakages. I then secured the bread mold together with heavy-duty masking tape, making sure to bind it as tightly as possible to seal the gaps. I left a hole at the top of the bread to allow the beeswax to be poured in. This would’ve also allowed the bread to sit on its base to dry out, thus allowing more stability (vs. pouring beeswax from the side). This took up a lot of tape and time.</p>

<p><em>Observations:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>The deeper the impression, the easier it was to fill the molds (so that fillings would not spill out)</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>The orientation in which to fill the molds also mattered to ensure that bread could stand upright to dry out without needing fixtures to secure it in place</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>The crumb structure did affect how the molds were filled — ones with a more open crumb tended to have beeswax/sulphur spill into the air pockets as well</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>2 piece mold was much more difficult to prepare than a 1 piece mold. I wonder how people in the past would’ve secured the bread pieces together if it were not for tape…</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Some of my classmates also gouged out the fillings of their bread before shaping it into a mold. That produced a tighter crumb and made a better impression. Must check through recipes and see if this process would’ve been intuitive.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>It was difficult to judge the volume of beeswax/sulphur needed for the molds, and this probably had to come with experience</p>

<p><strong>2:15pm:</strong> Starting with #1, I tried prying the mold out from the bread. Even with the linseed oil, much of the bread still clung onto the mold. This was a destructive process as most of the bread had to be pried away bit by bit, given its hardness, and I did not manage to preserve the original mold.</p>

<p>#2 and #3 came off easily, likely due to the size. I was surprised to see the details of the nail grooves captured in #2, though some of the sulphur filled the air pockets in #2 as well, despite a tighter crumb, leaving only a vague impression of the original object.</p>
