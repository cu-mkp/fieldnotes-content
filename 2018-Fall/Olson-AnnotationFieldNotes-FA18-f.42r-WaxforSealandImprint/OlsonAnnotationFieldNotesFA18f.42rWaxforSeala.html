to 43.33&deg; C (between 105&deg; and 110&deg; F). &nbsp;It was my assumption that, if the water was too hot, the wax would simply melt, so I had to keep the temperature of the water well below the wax&rsquo;s melting point of between 62&deg; and 65&deg; C.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Almost immediately, it became clear that the temperature of the water was rising too quickly. &nbsp;I removed the pot from the hot plate and added tap water in small increments. &nbsp;Once the temperature of the water fell to about 45&deg;

&nbsp;After about 5 minutes, I tried kneading it on a sheet of newsprint on the countertop, using my knuckles and the heel of my hand. &nbsp;That technique was not any more successful, and it resulted in bits of newsprint sticking to the bottom surface of the wax. &nbsp;I removed the bits of paper, and tried again to knead the wax on the countertop, but this time on a sheet of wax paper. &nbsp;(The temperature of the countertop must have been below room-temperature, so that probably was not helping to raise the temperature of the wax.)</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">After working on the wax for approximately 10 to 15 minutes using only my hands to raise its temperature to the point where it became pliable, I concluded that it would be necessary to immerse the wax in the pot of tepid water to achieve the requisite consistency.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Of course, by this point, the temperature of the water in the pot had fallen, and it needed to be reheated. &nbsp;I placed the wax in the pot of tepid water and left it for approximately 3 minutes. &nbsp;When I removed the wax from the water, I dried it off with a cloth napkin (unfortunately, not particularly absorbent).</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">I immediately began trying to knead the wax again by hand. &nbsp;At first, the wax was still quite hard to manipulate, but after a few minutes, it started to soften. &nbsp;I continued to knead it for 3 to 5 minutes, shaping it roughly into a disk.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><a id="t.57e215c8e40a447c96cf92bf66b59d17008b7089"></a><a id="t.3"></a><table class="c23"><tbody><tr class="c19"><td class="c28" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c11"><span class="c17 c6">Image URL:</span></p></td><td class="c15" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c11"><span class="c7"><a class="c8" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.flickr.com/photos/128418753@N06/31533825037/in/album-72157704898717615/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1576524748996000">https://www.flickr.com/photos/128418753@N06/31533825037/in/album-72157704898717615/</a></span></p></td></tr><tr class="c1"><td class="c9" colspan="2" rowspan="1"><p class="c11"><span style="overflow: hidden;

[you will] put three or four pieces of paper on [top of it] and, with a stick, even and round like a pestle, you will roll it as if you wanted to polish it. . .&rdquo; &nbsp;My interpretation of these instructions was that the purpose of the &ldquo;polishing&rdquo; action was to push the wax into the mold, to ensure that the wax found its way into all the nooks and crannies of the matrix, without the artisan having to rely on exerting pressure from above to accomplish this.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">In order to carry out the instructions to &ldquo;polish&rdquo; the wax using a pestle, I needed to invert the matrix so that its open face would be facing upward. &nbsp;The presence of the wooden handle affixed to the bottom of the mold forced me to devise a solution that would allow the matrix to be balanced in the inverted position, while accommodating the protruding handle. &nbsp;I fitted a sturdy cardboard tube, slightly longer than the handle, over the handle and then placed the seal matrix-wax unit in the &ldquo;sandbox&rdquo; that is kept in the SE fume hood. &nbsp;The cardboard tube, with a diameter of 1 &frac12;&rdquo; and embedded at least 1 &frac12;&rdquo; &nbsp;into the sand, provided ample support and stability for the seal matrix-wax unit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">I placed 2 small sheets of newsprint on top of the wax as the recipe instructs and to prevent the pestle from becoming contaminated by the wax. &nbsp;I then moved the pestle over the paper covering the wax, sometimes just pressing the pestle down, sometimes forcing it forward in a plowing motion. &nbsp;As I did so, the sheets of newsprint began to take on the shape of the underlying wax, and I could see, somewhat indistinctly, how the shape of the wax responded to the pressure of the pestle.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">When I was confident that the wax had conformed to the shape of the seal matrix, I eased the wax out of the seal matrix by pulling gently on the sheets of paper. &nbsp;The recipe says, &ldquo; . . . the paper . . . will help you lift it off the mold,&rdquo; and it also says that the wax &ldquo; . . . will attach itself to the paper. &nbsp;Small bits of the newsprint paper had adhered to the bottom of the wax; I did not attempt to remove them for fear of damaging the impression left by the seal matrix.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The following photograph shows that the the wax generally conformed to the shape of the matrix, but it did not penetrate to the outer rim of some of the &ldquo;petals.&rdquo; &nbsp;This was probably because the upper surface of the wax disk, onto which the cookie mold was pressed, was not perfectly flat and was higher in the middle than around the edges. &nbsp;Consequently, the outer edges of some of the &ldquo;petals&rdquo; taper off or appear depressed relative to the forms at the center of the mold. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><a id="t.0181c41ae2d5deddcac9f68ec7ee28d33f3ace08"></a><a id="t.4"></a><table class="c23"><tbody><tr class="c19"><td class="c28" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c11"><span class="c17 c6">Image URL:</span></p></td><td class="c15" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c11"><span class="c7"><a class="c8" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.flickr.com/photos/128418753@N06/46473623241/in/album-72157704898717615/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1576524749002000">https://www.flickr.com/photos/128418753@N06/46473623241/in/album-72157704898717615/</a></span></p></td></tr><tr class="c1"><td class="c9" colspan="2" rowspan="1"><p class="c11"><span style="overflow: hidden;

should be added to &ldquo;bind&rdquo; the mixture. &nbsp;It seemed clear that the lead white was the more important of the two ingredients to be added, but with no guidance as to quantity, I decided to do three trials. &nbsp;Each would require adding a small amount of lead white and a &ldquo;drop&rdquo; of larch turpentine to the molten wax, but after the first two trials, a portion of the wax-lead white mixture would be removed so that the proportion of lead white in the mixture would increase with each successive trial.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Before beginning the trials with lead white, I removed the following quantities from the melted beeswax to serve as controls:</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><ul class="c13 lst-kix_du62m7qhiei2-0 start"><li class="c0 c5"><span class="c3">Approximately 1 tablespoon spooned off onto a piece of wax paper to serve as a sample for testing malleability;</span></li><li class="c0 c5"><span class="c3">Approximately 1 tablespoon spooned off onto a piece of paper to test with a seal device;
