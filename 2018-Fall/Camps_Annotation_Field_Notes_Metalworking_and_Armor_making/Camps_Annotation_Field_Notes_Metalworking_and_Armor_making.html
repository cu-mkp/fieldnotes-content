<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Course description</p>
<p>As part of the annotation on “black varnish for sword guard, bands for trunks, etc.” on fol. 4r, I aim to make a sword guard under guidance of master armorer <a href="https://www.wassonartistry.com/"><em>Jeff Wasson</em></a> in his course on medieval amoring. I will then apply the reconstructed varnish [see my <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZWC1MxsgIvN56pEyWdWy_OB3BcjMEMwJ0Q8AEjAQKPY/edit"><em>field notes</em></a>] to this sword guard to see if and how the object plays into the use and purpose of the varnish.</p>
<p><strong>Selecting a sword guard to reconstruct<br />
</strong></p>
<p>On folio 95v (a continuation of the entry on the furbisher, starting on fol. 94r), the author-practitioner of the manuscript mentions a number of different guards:</p>
<p><strong>Transcription</strong> (TC):</p>
<p>Les gardes sont de plusieurs sortes</p>
<p>A ouvraiges</p>
<p>A goutiere qui est a mouleures rondes</p>
<p>A perles</p>
<p>A escharpe quand les bandes sont de travers</p>
<p>A oignon qui est teste platte</p>
<p>A mode de roy qui sont plaines</p>
<p><strong>Translation</strong> (TL):<br />
Guards are of several kinds</p>
<p>Worked [according to Jonathan Tavares this probably means chased/chiselled]</p>
<p>Guttered which is with round mouldings</p>
<p>Pearled</p>
<p>Scarfed when the bands are crosswise</p>
<p>Onioned which is with a flat head [according to Jonathan Tavares the author is probably talking about the pommel here, rather than about the guard]</p>
<p>In the King's manner, which are plain</p>
<p>However, it is difficult to know exactly what the sword guards the author-practitioner is describing here looked like since there are no drawings accompanying the descriptions.</p>
<p>Although there is an image of a sword guard on folio 94r (where the ‘chapter’ on furbishers starts) (see image 1) , we don’t know if such a guard would have been blackened.</p>

<p>In order to be as historically authentic as possible in my reconstruction, my plan was therefore to look for an extant blackened sword guard of French origin, fashioned around 1580 (which is when the manuscript was probably written)</p>
<p>I looked at the arms and armor collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Wallace Collection in London as well as at the swords at the Art Institute of Chicago.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it proved near impossible to locate a sword of French origin, made around 1580, which would be feasible to reconstruct in the short amount of time I had.</p>
<p>According to Jonathan Tavares, associate curator of arms, armor and European decorative arts before 1700 at the Art Institute of Chicago, &quot;it is difficult to know the origins of rapiers--we are not able to localize them as easily as armor or firearms for example--the style for swords were more widespread. Thus it is difficult to say what is French vs. Italian, etc.”<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>In consultation with Jeff Wasson, I chose a <em><em>blackened</em></em> sword guard (or hilt) of German origin (image 2), made between 1580 and 1590 and currently on display at the Wallace Collection in London.</p>

<p>In addition to the fact that this particular sword guard was fashioned around 1580, we believed this type of guard would also be fitting to reconstruct for several other reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Since I have reconstructed a black varnish for sword guards, I wanted to fashion a type of guard which sixteenth-century armor makers would have actually applied such a varnish to. Although there are no extant examples of sword guards, or other armor, that has black varnish on it, the fact that this particular German sword guard was blackened, makes it reasonable to assume they could have applied varnish to such a guard as well.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Given that we only have 5 sessions in this workshop and I have very little to no skills or experience in the making of armor, I would have to select a guard that would not be too complicated to make and could be fashioned in the little time I had. Jeff Wasson was convinced that it would be possible to reconstruct this particular guard in a few sessions.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Since there are no period sources describing how to make the guards, any reconstruction of one was dependent on Jeff Wasson’s ability to visualize, through a study of the object, the process of how it could have been made. Jeff had a very clear understanding of how German armor makers may have fashioned this particular sword guard, thus enabling us to reconstruct it.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Finally, in order to make the most out of this armoring workshop, and to put every single session to the best possible use, I wanted to make a guard that would allow me to apply the techniques I learned throughout the workshop in the making of the object.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>This particular German guard would allow me do so.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Description course:</strong></p>
<p>See Jeff’s website <a href="https://www.wassonartistry.com/classes"><em>here</em></a></p>
<p>Learn about medieval armor and metalworking from master armorer Jeff Wasson. In this class students will study the craft of the medieval armorer and will make a project inspired by medieval plate armor, based on the techniques learned during the class.</p>
<p>The use of ancient armoring techniques to shape and form metal has great potential for creating interesting metalwork. Students will work in Jeff's workshop, and get a hands on instruction into the art and craft of the medieval armorer. Students will learn how to hammer, dish, planish, flute, rivet, and articulate sheet metal plates. Students will learn how to finish metal with grinding, sanding, polishing and blackening. Both ancient and modern techniques will be explored.</p>
<p>Students will make their own project, inspired by medieval armor, based on the techniques learned during the class. All materials and tools will be supplied.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Safety guidelines: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Wear work clothes such as jeans, boots, and work shirt. The shop can be dirty and we will be grinding/ sanding. So protective clothes that you are not afraid of getting dirty should be worn.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Wear safety glasses/ear protection/work gloves.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Metal</strong></p>
<p>In this first session of the workshop we will be working with 16 gage mild steel.</p>
<p>The gage (also spelled gauge) indicates the thickness of the steel. The higher the number, the thinner the metal; the lower the number, the thicker the metal (Image 3 &amp; 4).</p>
<p>The thickness of the metal used for armor depends on what part of the body you’re trying to protect.</p>
<p>The thicker the metal, the higher the risk it will collapse.</p>
<p>The gage of the metal will change through its reworking (e.g. through the hammering, dishing, etc.).</p>
<p>The quality of steel can be checked through a ‘spark test’. By holding the metal you want to test against a belt sanding machine, sparks will fly off of the metal and turn into stardust. The amount of sparks tells you something about the amount of carbon in the steel.</p>
<p>Not all medieval steel has enough carbon in it for it to be hardened and tempered.</p>
<p><em>Safety tip:</em> always make sure that the sparks are flying in the direction of the floor (Image 5).</p>
<p>Also pay close attention to the tools you’re using: they are often marked with an arrow indicating which direction to work in.</p>

<p><strong>Location:</strong> Jeff Wasson’s workshop - Ridgewood, New York.</p>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Introduction - Measuring the body</p>
<p>The first step in making armor is measuring the body of the wearer (length, circumference, etc.)</p>
<p>Jeff Wasson tries to note down as much information as possible about the body of the wearer.</p>
<p>Leg armor is one of the most important parts of a knight’s armor as this allows the wearer to move around. Jeff always makes a plaster cast of the wearer’s leg to make sure the greaves (and other armor protecting the legs) fit properly (image 6).</p>
<p>Some armor makers also make a full body cast.</p>
<p>According to Jeff Wasson making armor is all about anatomical knowledge; understanding the human body and how it moves.</p>
<p>As Tobias Capwell, curator of arms and armor at the Wallace Collection in London, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ptV0h0Kwjc&amp;t=1954s"><em>put</em></a> it (see minute 32:20 in the link): “[Armor is] engineered to follow the movements of the human body very precisely. Lumbering around, clunking around would be a danger to your knightly dignity as well as to your life.”</p>
<p><strong>Reflection and questions:</strong></p>
<p>This made me wonder to what extent the making of armor would not just involve and require knowledge of the human body and how it moved, but perhaps more specifically (and most importantly) knowledge of how the human body moved <em>in battle</em> -- and thus knowledge of fighting techniques?</p>
<p>I suspect that in attacking an opponent or defending oneself against one’s enemies, a soldier or knight would move in a highly specific manner that would, or at least could, expose certain body parts to danger, making him more prone to being struck by a weapon when not properly or fully protected by armor.</p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Would an armor maker who had knowledge of how soldiers moved while in battle (that is, how they attacked someone or defended themselves) and, thus, of which body parts would require more, less, or specific kinds of protection, also be better able to determine what <em>type</em> of armor was needed to protect those soldier or knights?</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>To what extent does the development of armor coincide, not just with the development of a craftsman’s tools, materials and techniques, but also with the development of his knowledge and understanding of fighting techniques and the highly specific bodily movements of a soldier or knight?</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Is there any evidence of craftsmen having fighting experience? Or soldiers making or contributing to the production of their own armor? Or were these two distinct social roles?</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>To what extent does knowledge or understanding of the human body and the way it moves help in the making of armor? Is it a requirement?</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>To what extent does the craft of making armor increase one’s understanding of the body?</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>How much anatomical knowledge/knowledge of the body did sixteenth-century armor makers have? Was it part of their training?</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Does the experience of having worn an armor yourself help in the making of arms and armour? Is it necessary for knowing how to make armor?</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Do we know if sixteenth-century armor makers had experience wearing armor themselves? How did craftsmen learn what would be a properly fitting or ‘comfortable’ armor and what to pay attention to in the making of it?</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Through doing and trial and error? Through first-hand experience? Through the</p>
<p>communication with their commissioners? All of the above?</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>What do we know about communication that took place between armor makers and their commissioners (i.e. the ones wearing the armor)? Is there evidence of communication/feedback between maker and wearer about ‘fitting’ and the improvement thereof?</p>
</blockquote></li>

<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Introduction - Cutting the steel</p>
<p><strong>Material:</strong> 16 gage mild steel<br />
<strong>Tools:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Steel cutting shear</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Sledge hammer</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Anvil</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<p>When you have measured everything, you need to cut the steel plates into the appropriate shape using a steel shear (image 7).</p>
<p>In the medieval and early modern period, they would not have had such a mechanical shear, but probably used a shear as shown in image (image 8)</p>
<p>Jeff Wasson uses patterns for this so he won’t have to reinvent the wheel every time (image 9).</p>
<p>Although we cannot know for sure, Jeff thinks it is very likely that medieval and early modern armor makers used patterns as well.</p>
<p>To get the right shape, Jeff draws the shape that oughts to be cut with a black marker on the metal sheet (either by freehanding or by tracing the contours of a pattern).</p>
<p>First cut the piece free from the large metal plate, then cut off all of the excess and finally trim it by following the black lines.</p>
<p>To cut, place the sheet in the shear and make sure that the ‘knife’ of the tool will come down on the drawn line (when pulling down the lever). When cutting the steel, it is very important that you don’t go off this drawn line (image 10).</p>
<p>The cutting of the steel may cause for the metal to curve slightly (image 11)].</p>
<p>You therefore need to smoothen this out by placing the piece of metal on an anvil and hammering out the uneven parts (image 12 &amp; 14). Use a hammer with weight and hit it on the curved edges. Always make sure your fingers are removed from the parts to be hit with the hammer (you can also use a clamp/vice grips (image 13) to place the steel on the anvil).</p>

<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Introduction - punching holes</p>
<p><strong>Material:</strong> steel plate</p>
<p><strong>Tools: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Modern technique: steel hole puncher machine</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Medieval technique:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>center punch;</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>anvil/woodblock</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>sledge hammer</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>In order to attach separate pieces of armor to one another, to make armor articulate, or create air holes, you need to punch holes into the metal.</p>
<p>This can be done in two ways:</p>
<p><strong>Modern technique:</strong> use a steel hole puncher (image 15) to cut through the metal. This requires placing the sheet of metal in between the puncher and pulling down the lever.</p>
<p><strong>Historical technique:</strong></p>
<p>In the medieval period, they did not have such a machine and they would have done this manually by using a center punch (image 16) and a hammer. The center punch is a metal rod that has a pointy tip and a flat end.</p>
<p>To punch a hole in the metal, you first need to place your sheet on an anvil or woodblock. Then place the center punch on the place where you want to create the hole. Keep the center punch in place while striking on its flat end with a hammer (image 17).</p>
<p>This will first create a divot (a disruption in the surface level). Then use a flat punch (i.e. with a flat tip) to make this divot more pronounced (sometimes you need to hammer several times on the disrupted metal surface to punch a hole in the material).</p>
<p>When you’re working with thick metal it might be difficult to punch through the metal. Heating the metal first will soften the material, thus making it easier to punch a hole.</p>
<p><strong>Difference modern and historical technique: </strong></p>
<p>In addition to the fact that using a cutting machine is faster than punching a hole manually, there is another difference between the modern and historical technique.</p>
<p>As can be seen in image 18, in contrast to the modern cutting machine, the center punch leaves a trace in the form of a bur; that is, the surface level contours of the hole are not smooth or even, but are slightly raised. This would have had to be evened out by means of sanding/grinding.</p>

<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Introduction - Deburring and beveling edges</p>
<p><strong>Material:</strong> steel plate</p>
<p><strong>Tools:</strong> belt sanding machine, angle grinder</p>
<p><strong>Safety:</strong> safety goggles</p>
<p>Similar to the process of <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/19av-1SauM-d65XahSRa4fVpIKMVuStRcOG_uRrhF6Mc/edit#"><em>preparing a printing plate</em></a> (see entry ‘2018.10.22, 13:10 pm’ in link), the edges of steel pieces for armor also need to be deburred.</p>
<p>In the context of printing this is needed so the sharp edges won’t damage your printing paper.</p>
<p>In the context of armor making deburring the edges of metal serves a somewhat similar purpose: Since armor serves a functional purpose (i.e. in that it will be worn and used) it is crucial to bevel/debur the edges of the steel plates. Knights wore jackets/coats underneath their armor and sharp edges could damage these or, worse, injure the wearer. Additionally, swords or other weapons could get easily caught in sharp or rough edges. Beveled edges could prevent this: swords striking the armor would slide right off of beveled edges.</p>
<p>Jeff Wasson uses an angle grinder and/or belt sanding machine (Image 19) to bevel the edges of the steel.</p>
<p>In the middle ages (or early modern period), they would most likely have used a file. Beveling and sanding by hand is time consuming. Given that we only have a limited amount of time, we will bevel and sand mechanically.</p>
<p>Always hold the steel at the edges and be careful that your fingers and knuckles are not too close to the grinder/sanding machine. The belt rotates at high speed and you can injure yourself severely if too close to the machine.</p>
<p>Never sand <em>into</em> the edge (Image 20). The rotating belt will always want to bounce off the metal if you do so. Always sand off of the edges (Image 21).</p>
<p>To sand, move your steel plate from left to right alongside the rotating belt. Keep enough pressure, but not too much as this will remove too much metal.</p>

<p>Since I had never worked with power tools or a belt sanding machine I had to get used to the force of the tool. When I pushed the metal sheet against the sanding belt, I did not expect the belt to bounce off the metal sheet.You feel resistance; something pushing back. It took me a while to find the right angle and balance between using enough pressure to bevel the edges sufficiently but not too much to grind off too much metal.</p>
<p>It took about five minutes for me to bevel all edges on both sides of the metal. This would have taken much more time when using a file.</p>

<p>Dishing (also called sinking) is the next step in the process. It is a pretty modern technique, but according to Jeff Wasson they might have also known about this in the Middle Ages.</p>
<p>Dishing involves both giving shape and volume to the metal and to strengthen it (through hammering).</p>
<p>Hammering will harden the metal, which will make it stronger and increase its resistance to weapons (and thus improve its protecting abilities).</p>
<p>Yet making the metal too hard (hammering too much) will make it brittle and more likely to crack.</p>
<p><em>Armor</em> can have different shapes</p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>round (e.g. a helmet) --</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>gutter shaped (like a tube)</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>anticlastic (e.g. greaves)<br />
This shape is easier to achieve when the metal is hot.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Hammers</em> can have different shapes and weights (image 22)</p>
<p>Always use a sledge hammer with mass (i.e. weight). Always hammer on an anvil or wood block.</p>
<p>In order to shape, or to curve, the metal place your sheet on a woodblock with hollows in it (image 23) and push the metal into the hole by hitting it with the hammer (image 24). Make sure that the sheet is making contact around the hollows. You can use vice grips to hold the metal, place it on the woodblock and prevent hammering on your fingers.</p>
<p>If you hit the metal in the right place, it will bent into the hollow of the wood and take on its shape.</p>
<p>For deep hollows, use a hammer with a round face.</p>
<p>In order to shape or curve the metal the way you want it to, you need to hit the metal on the right spot. This requires having control over the hammer, and in turn, over your wrist.</p>
<p>If you don’t have control over either of the two, the hammer will hit the metal all over the place and it will be bent out of shape.</p>
<p>N.B. to get an even curve, you need to exert the right amount of pressure with the hammer on all sides.</p>
<p>If your sheet is lumpy/bumpy, hammer it more to smoothen it.</p>
<p><strong>Experience: </strong></p>
<p>I struggled striking the metal at the same and right spot and my hammer bounced off the metal repeatedly. This indicated I wasn’t in good control of my hammer and I thus needed to have a firmer grip on the tool. My wrist action was too loose. Firming that grip also made me experience how tiring hammering can be on your body (having to keep a firm grip and exerting a sufficient amount of pressure on the metal over an extended period of time), especially when making large pieces of armor.</p>

<p><strong>Materials:</strong> Steel plate</p>
<p><strong>Tools:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Sledge hammer</p>

<p>Planishing is the hammering of the metal to even out the irregularities created by the dishing. In doing so, you will equally add more volume to the metal sheet.</p>
<p>Planishing basically means squeezing the metal sheet between an anvil and a hammer.</p>
<p>Key to planishing is finding the right hammer; that is, a hammer that matches the shape of the the metal sheet you’re working with and has the right weight.</p>
<p>If you choose a hammer that is too light, you won’t have enough impact with each blow and you will end up planishing for a long time.</p>
<p>You can planish on either the inside or the outside of the metal.</p>
<p>When making a helmet, for example, it will be difficult to find a hammer that matches the strong curve of the helmet. In this case, it is best to planish on the outside of the metal by placing it on a ball stake (image 27 &amp; image 28) and use a hammer with a flat face. Make sure to always hit the center of the helmet (which is in contact with the ball stake). The edges of the hammer are sharp and hitting the metal at the wrong angle could cause dents.</p>

<p>As with the dishing, you want to make sure that the face of the hammer has the best possible impact with each blow. In order to do this you need to hit the metal on the same spot repeatedly and with the same impact in order to get an even curve and to evenly smoothen out the irregularities.</p>
<p>To have more control over the blow of the hammer and to make sure you hit the metal at the same spot, hold the hammer closer to its head (with a firm wrist grip). If your wrist movement is too loose, the hammer will hit the metal in various places and you won’t get an even curve.</p>
<p>Sound (i.e. your senses) is very important in this part of the process. What you want to hear is a solid ring when striking the metal with the hammer. When you hear a hollow sound upon striking the metal, you know that the spot you are targeting is not in full contact with the surface of the anvil and you’re holding your sheet at the wrong angle. This can be corrected, either by hitting the metal at a different spot --which is touching the anvil-- or by repositioning the metal, i.e. changing the angle at which you’re holding it. This is where the vice grips come in handy. You can move and turn the metal easily while hammering (without running the risk of hitting your fingers or letting the metal sheet slip from your hands).</p>
<p>It will take practice to find the right amount of pressure to exert with the hammer.</p>
<p>When done correctly, the planishing should leave small circles across the surface level of the metal (image 29).</p>
<p>According to Jeff Wasson, the tools that one uses in the making of armor leave their traces/marks.</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> if the tools used in the making of armor leave their traces, can historical armor, or, more specifically, an analysis of the marks it bears then serve as a way to better understand or get at the tools early modern practitioners used in the making of armor?</p>
<p><strong><em>Answer Jeff Wasson</em>:</strong> It is possible, to some extent, to analyze the marks left on pieces of armor as a way of getting at the kinds of tools armor makers used in their craft -- although this is very difficult.</p>
<p><strong>Experience: </strong></p>
<p>As with the dishing, I struggled hitting the metal in the same place and getting an even curve. The result of this was that I did not succeed in getting these tiny circles (compare for example (image 29 &amp; image 30) (dished sheet by Jeff Wasson) and (image 31 &amp; image 32) (my dished sheet).</p>

<p><strong>Location:</strong> Jeff Wasson’s workshop - Ridgewood, New York.</p>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Introduction - Polishing</p>
<p><strong>Material:</strong> Steel plate</p>
<p><strong>Tools:</strong> various grinding machines (see below)</p>
<p><strong>Safety:</strong> safety glasses, ear protection</p>
<p>The next step in the process is polishing the armor to give it a shiny finish.</p>
<p>Polishing will also remove tool marks left on the metal in the process of dishing, planishing, hole cutting etc.</p>
<p><strong>General tips for polishing: </strong></p>
<p><em><em>Direction: </em></em></p>
<p>Jeff advises to polish your plate in the same direction. That is, moving your plate against the grinding machines from left to right and <em><em>not</em></em> from left to right and back (i.e. cross direction).</p>
<p>However, if you really want that high mirror finish, you need to polish in cross direction.</p>
<p><em><em>Consistency:</em></em></p>
<p>For all polishing the rule is to be consistent. If you are making a full armor you want each separate piece to have the same type of finish. That is, you don’t want to have the breast plate and greaves showing a rough finish and have the shoulder defense mirror polished.</p>
<p><strong>Grit: </strong></p>
<p>As with regular sanding paper, belts come in different grits as well.</p>
<p>The number of the grit tells you something about the particle size.</p>
<p>The smaller the number, the coarser the grit; the higher the number, the finer the grit.</p>
<p><strong>Modern Machines:</strong></p>
<p>Jeff Wasson uses various machines for polishing.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><blockquote>
<p>Belt sander:</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>The belt sander is used for general beveling, deburring and sanding.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Jeff has two types of grits for the belt: 60 and 80. We are currently using a 60 grit belt.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Compare this, for example, to the grit of the sandpaper used in the sanding of a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D49W4OUgaeZlLj_1wFL5xjZJVOC5G4QO2auVBlnYqQ0/edit#heading=h.osg4mljw1t33"><em>copper plate</em></a> for printing and the one used in our preparation of the metal sheets for amor-- see entry ‘2018.10.22, 10:05 pm’ in the link). For the copper plate we used a fine grit of 600 and 1200. For the armor sheets we are using a more coarse grit between 80 and 180.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>2. The second machine (image 33) also has a rotating sandpaper belt, but of a finer grit: 80.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>This machine has a horizontal rotating belt (as opposed to machine number 1, whose belt rotates vertically). This allows you to sand or polish metal sheets shaped or curved in a certain way better than you could with belt sander 1.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Using this machine will refine the polishing</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>3. Flap sander wheel:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>This wheel is made of a series of pieces of sandpaper on a wheel (image 34 &amp; 35).</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Jeff uses a grit of 120 and 180</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>When used after sanding machines 1 &amp; 2, the flap sander machine will give your sheet a highly shiny look (approximating the mirror finish).</p>

<p><strong>Historical technique: </strong></p>
<p>* They probably used a file to polish armor and perhaps a mill or water driven wheel. According to Jeff, the polishing by hand with a file would only take away “mountains”. The flap sander wheel on the other hand, will go into the “hills and valleys”. It will allow you to create a uniform curvature instead of having your sheet look modeled and uneven.</p>
<p>Both Jonathan Tavares and Jeff Wasson have pointed out that historically speaking polishing was very time consuming and expensive. One third of the cost of armor lay in its polishing.</p>
<p>As a consequence, one had to really trust polishers to do their job well.</p>
<p><strong>Historical and modern aesthetics </strong></p>
<p>Historical armor displays much more marks/scratches than modern-made armor.</p>
<p>According to Jeff Wasson we are so concerned nowadays with symmetry and perfection that we tend to forget this was not the concern of armor makers in the medieval period. These practitioners were much more interested and concerned with shape and an organic aesthetic.</p>
<p>Modern armor is also often characterized by a highly shiny, mirror finish, which is indicative of our aesthetic preference.</p>
<p>With historical armor, in contrast, you see a lot more different types and levels of finish, ranging from rough to a highly polished mirror finish.</p>
<p><strong>Question: </strong></p>
<p>To what extent can the level and type of finish of historical armor tell us something about the skills of a polisher? Additionally, if polishing was expensive and a high amount of polishing would be more costly than less polishing, can the finish of period armor then also tell us more about the status and economic position of the wearer/commissioner (I am assuming that someone who was well endowed could probably afford more polishing to be done on his armor than someone of lower social standing)?</p>
<p><strong><em>Answer Jeff Wasson</em>:</strong> Yes. Both.</p>
<p>Dukes would often wear highly polished and gilded armor whereas the armor of a common soldier would probably have a rough(er) finish.</p>
<p>But achieving a mirror finish would also require skill. Not all polishers were able to do this.</p>

<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p><strong>Besagues</strong> (image 39): besagues, like rondels (circular in shape), could hang off the breastplate and served to protect the armpits. Before the 15th century, armpits were not protected by a long shoulder defense (pauldrons) and were thus vulnerable (soldiers wore mail underneath their armor for this reason). From the 15th century you see that shoulder defense in armor is going all the way up the neck to fill this gap at the armpit. The downside of this type of shoulder defense was that they limited a soldier’s/knight’s ability to move and added to the weight of an armor.</p>
</blockquote></li>

<p><strong>Question: </strong></p>
<p>What is the purpose of crests? Are they purely aesthetic or do they serve a practical purpose as well?</p>
<p><em>Answer Jeff Wasson:</em> the crest served various purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Decoration (German gothic armor, for example, is known for its crests and flutes)</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Adding rigidity to the piece of armor</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Protective: a crested piece of armor could act to either stop, for example, the strike of a sword, or glance it off, thus preventing a weapon from cutting straight through the metal.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How to make a crest?</strong></p>
<p>(for instructions of steps 1-5, see previous entries)</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><blockquote>
<p>Start with drawing a shape on a metal plate with a black marker (freehanding or using a pattern)</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Cut the piece free from the plate, remove the excess and trim it by following the shape.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Remove any burrs and bevel the edges</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Add volume/curvature through dishing</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Add more volume by planishing</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ol>
<p><em><em>Add the crest</em></em> image 40 shows what such a sheet looks like after steps 1-5)</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><blockquote>
<p>You can make a crest in two ways:</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Woodblock &amp; chisel: Jeff prefers using a woodblock with hollows in the form of lines (image 41). To make the crest:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Draw a line in the metal with a black marker where you want to have a crest</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Now look for a fitting chisel. There are different types of chisels (image 42 &amp; 46) It is important you choose a chisel whose head fits into the grooves of the wood. In other words, the shape of the chisel needs to follow the curvature of the hollow.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Once you have picked a chisel, place the sheet on the woodblock (inside of the metal facing up), making sure that the black line you drew extends into the hollow line of the woodblock (image 43)</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Take a hammer with a flat head.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Hold the sheet in position and place the head (shaped part) of the chisel perpendicular on the black line (image 43)</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Hit the hammer on the flat end of the chisel, and move the chisel forward along the line after each blow, repeating the steps. This blow of the hammer will push the crest into place as it bents the metal into the hollow of the wood, taking on its shape (as you do with dishing on the woodblock). You will now create a crest or raised part on the outside of the metal (image 44 &amp; 45)</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Stake and bench-screw:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>As the crest will still look rather rough, you can make it more pronounced and sharp by means of a stake (image 46) and bench-screw.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Place a stake (shaped head facing up) in a bench-screw (again: make sure the shape of the stake follows and fits in the groove of the crest)</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Place the metal sheet perpendicular on the head of the stake by pushing it into the hollow (or crest) (image 47 and image 48).</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Take a flat hammer and hit the metal right alongside the edge of stake’s head (image 49). This is a very difficult technique as you cannot see through the metal and it is difficult to know where to hit the metal exactly. This takes practice.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>If you’ve hammered too much or want to adjust the line/crest, for example by making it less pronounced, you need to hammer on the inside of the metal (alongside the line).</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>You can also skip the woodblock step and only use the stake and bench-screw to create a crest. However, Jeff advises always starting with the woodblock since working with the bank-screw doesn’t allow you to see what you are doing, making the process very complicated. Using the woodblock as a start helps make the process of creating a crest easier.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>7. The hammering will have left marks alongside the crest (image 50); you can remove these by sanding and polishing.</p>

<p>The first step in making the sword guard was to draw its design on a piece of paper. Jeff believed it best to draw to life size.</p>
<p>In order to do so, we used the guard of a two-handed bastard sword Jeff had at his workshop as a model (image 51).</p>

<p>I placed the upper part of the sword on a sheet of paper and traced the contours of the blade, the sword guard, handle and part of the pommel with a pencil (image 52 and image 53).</p>

<p>This drawing would allow us to easily determine the dimensions of the sword guard because we could draw it right onto the paper model.</p>
<p>Next, Jeff drew the front and top view of the sword guard, based on an image I brought of the armor (image 54), onto and above the drawn sword.</p>

<p>We decided to start with the most easy shape: the clam (serving to protect the hand from impact).</p>
<p>I thus drew half of the clam-shaped part of the guard on a separate piece of paper (image 55 &amp; 56), using the drawn paper sword to determine its dimensions.</p>
<p>To make the left and right side of the clam symmetrical, I drew a line in the middle with a ruler and folded the paper alongside that line (image 57).</p>
<p>Then, keeping the paper folded, I cut out the clam shape with a pair of scissors.</p>
<p>Jeff advised me to not worry about cutting out the grooves or curves of the clam, but to only cut out the clam’s round contours.</p>

<p>For the sword guard I will be using 14 gage 1050 steel (on advice of Jeff Wasson). This is slightly thicker steel than what I used for trying out the techniques in the introductory sessions (which was 16 gage; a higher number, thus thinner).</p>
<p>I then placed the paper clam on the metal sheet (image 58) and traced its contours with a black marker (image 59).</p>

<p><strong>Material:</strong> 14 gage, 1050 steel</p>
<p><strong>Tools:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Your metal plate with traced piece</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Steel shear (manual or mechanical)</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Tang</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Safety:</strong> Safety goggles, working gloves, ear protection.</p>
<p><em>Safety tips: </em></p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>since there was a lot of hammering going on around me, I wore ear protection (even when not hammering myself).</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>When you’re going to cut the metal, you might want to wear working gloves to prevent cutting yourself on the sharp edges (I only started doing this after a few minutes).</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Also wear goggles to protect your eyes against flying metal scraps.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<p>The next step was to cut the shape out of the metal.</p>
<p>As explained in the introductory session, I first had to cut the piece free from the large metal plate (image 60).</p>
<p>Once reduced in size, I cut off the excess metal from your piece (image 61 and image 62).</p>
<p>When the majority of metal had been removed, I started cutting out the actual shape by pulling down the ‘knife’ of the shear right alongside the black lines.</p>
<p>In order to get an even, smooth curved clam, I had to cut out the shape in one movement, or at least try. Since you cannot move the shear, I had to slowly rotate the sheet with my free (left) hand while cutting with the other (right) one.</p>
<p>In doing this, an iron filing curled on the edge of the sheet (image 63). At some point (as Jeff had already pointed out), the iron filing was too big and hampered my ability to cut. I thus had to to decurl it with a tang (image 64) and then cut it off with the shear in order to continue.</p>

<p>Once I had cut out the shape (image 65), I had to smoothen the edges, making them less sharp, and to give the clam an even curve (the iron filings had caused irregularities in the contours). I thus had to debur and bevel the edges with the three different sanding machines mentioned in the introductory sessions.</p>

<p>Jeff believed the metal we used in the previous session (14 gage) was a bit too thick for the sword guard, so he thought it best to use a thinner plate, and thus to start from scratch.</p>
<p>We chose to work with 16 gage 1050 steel.</p>
<p>Because Jeff thought it better to make the clams of the sword guard in one piece, rather than weld two separate pieces together, we had to draw a new pattern.</p>
<p>The following steps had to be repeated:</p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Drawing a design on a piece of paper to create a pattern</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Cutting out the paper design (image 66)</p>

<p>Placing the paper on the steel plate and tracing it’s contours with a black marker (image 67)</p>

<p>The complex curvature of the new pattern rendered the metal cutting process more difficult.</p>
<p>Since the shear would not be able to follow the exact curves in the middle of the pattern (i.e. where the two clams meet), we had to resort to a different method to cut the shape out of the steel.</p>
<p>Jeff suggested to punch holes into the curves -- two on each side (see image 68) -- and to use a chisel to create a cut and then push out the metal manually.</p>
<p>I thus first created a divot with a center punch and then punched the holes with the hole puncher.</p>

<p>Next, I used a chisel to punch a diagonal cross into the metal (each of the two lines extending into the holes), which would enable us to fully cut out the pattern.</p>
<p>To do so, I put the metal plate on the step or table of the anvil, (tip: never chisel on the face of the anvil) (see image 69), placed the chisel into the hole in a diagonal line and then punched a cross into the metal by hitting the chisel’s head with a hammer (image 70).</p>
<p>In order to create a visible (and deep enough) cross (and thus carve lines into the metal), you need to hit the hammer onto the chisel’s head “like you mean it”, i.e. with force.</p>
<p><strong>Reflection:<br />
</strong>I found this technique rather difficult.</p>
<p>Due to my lack of experience in hammering (and thus control over the hammer) and the small surface area of the chisel, I struggled hitting the chisel’s head, and either missed the target (and hit my own fingers instead) or did not hit it with enough force.</p>
<p>I realized that this technique also requires a lot of hand-eye coordination; a skill that is probably underdeveloped in my case.</p>
<p>Ultimately Jeff had to help create the cross.</p>

<p>As this last step has left rough edges, you need to smoothen or round out the curves.</p>
<p>The large curves that make up the clam shape can be rounded out with the belt sander (in the Middle Ages they would have done all this manually with a file) (remember to put on your safety glasses).</p>
<p>You cannot get into the smaller curves (where the holes were previously located) with the belt sander. You therefore need to use a file (image 73).</p>
<p>Clamp your metal sheet in a vise again and move the file in an upward direction (N.B. no cross-direction filing) until you have a smooth curve. To create more pressure and to make this easier, use both hands to hold the file (image 74)</p>
<p>Compare image 75 and image 76 to see the result of the filing.</p>

<p>The next step is to create the shape and grooves of the clam.</p>
<p>Before doing so, however, first clean your plate with soap and water (image 77) and dry it with paper towels.</p>
<p>Next, draw the lines of the clam with a black marker onto the metal (image 78).</p>

<p>Next, clamp you plate on a square piece of wood with vice grips (image 79), making sure the plate is securely locked into place and cannot move. Also make sure that you have enough room to move the angle grinder.</p>
<p>Then, to create the clam shape (or outer curvature), use an angle grinder to grind away the excess metal, tracing the outer black lines (N.B.: <em>NOT</em> the lines running towards the center of the plate; these are the grooves) (image 80; image 81; image 82).</p>
<p>In the Middle Ages and early modern period, they probably would have done this by means of (water-driven) grinding wheels. Given the little time we have, we’re expediting this process by using a power tool (the angle grinder).</p>
<p>It is best to grind in one smooth movement, with equal amount of pressure exerted at all times to create an even curve.</p>
<p><strong>Safety: </strong></p>
<p>Don’t forgot to grind in the right direction. I.e. with the sparks flying towards the floor.</p>

<p>The next step is to punch a hole/gap at the center of the metal plate for the sword to go through.</p>
<p>First, draw the shape of the hole on the metal plate with a black marker.</p>
<p>As before, punch two divots into the metal with a center punch. Then use the hole puncher to create two circular holes (Jeff used a drill, as we were running out of time) (image 86).</p>

<p>Next, use a chisel (whose head is the same width as the hole you’re trying to punch out), to carve a line alongside the horizontal black marks (image 87). Punching with enough force will allow the metal to come loose, which will then leave a hole (image 88).</p>

<p>The edges of the hole will be somewhat uneven and raised, so you will have to debur and bevel them with a file.</p>
<p>To do so, place your iron plate in a vice (image 89) and find a file that fits into the hole (image 90 &amp; image 91).</p>
<p>Then move the file in a cross direction (i.e. back and forth) until the edges of the hole are smooth.</p>
<p>The filing will have caused a burr at the outer parts/contours of the hole, which you will need to hammer out (on both sides) on an anvil.</p>

<p><strong>Heating the metal</strong></p>
<p>Jeff has created his own forge, made of firebricks (image 92 &amp; 93)</p>
<p>The firebricks keep the heat in much better and were thus selected by Jeff for their insulation properties. In contrast to normal bricks, firebricks are lightweight and contain a lot of air pockets. Although the downside of these kind of bricks is that they fall apart quite easily, the benefit, as mentioned, is their insulation properties. This is very important when you’re heating metal.</p>
<p>In addition to firebricks, Jeff also uses a so called insulation boards to keep the heat in the forge (image 94).</p>
<p>This forge runs on propane (gas). In the past, they would have used charcoal or wood as a heat source. Charcoal will burn more intense and allow for a higher temperature to be reached (enabling you to hit that crucial 1800 degrees upon which the light gets red/orange). Wood would only allow you to reach 1500 degrees.</p>
<p>Additionally they would have used bellows to oxygen into the fire which would have made it even more intense. N.B.: the airhole, that is, the hole where the air comes through will be the most hot.</p>
<p><em><strong>VERY important to keep in mind before proceeding:</strong></em> make sure that you have all the required materials and tools ready and know exactly where and how you want to hammer/shape your metal. Once the metal is hot enough, ready to be hammered and taken of the forge, you don’t have time organize things. You need to act immediately and quickly since the metal will cool off really fast. It is therefore advisable to practice the hammering and run through the necessary steps before turning on the fire/gas.</p>
<p>Once you have organized everything, turn on the gas (or ignite the heat source) (image 95), this will heat up the forge (image 96). Jeff places the gas tank in a bucket of water. In the process of heating up the forge, the pressure in the tank will drop and could cause it to freeze. The water will prevent this from happening.</p>
<p>Then, in order to heat your metal, place your piece on top of the forge and arrange the bricks on top and around it. You can localize the heat --i.e. heating only a particular part of your metal-- by placing the metal piece at a specific angle and use both the loose bricks to keep the piece into place (image 97 and image 98).</p>

<p><strong>Question: </strong></p>
<p>Would blacksmiths in the middle ages and early modern period also have adjusted their forge in order to help localize the heating of their metal plates/pieces?</p>
<p><em><strong>Answer Jeff Wasson:</strong></em> No, the kind of forge an armor maker would work with depended on the type of armor he was making. Armor maker’s workshops were thus set up differently and according to the specific and particular type of armor made in them (e.g.: gauntlets were made in one workshop, helmets in another and harnesses in yet another one, etc.). So workshops (and craftsmen) were highly specialized. Moreover, there was a strong division of labor. One person was in charge of the hammering, the other responsible for the polishing and someone else dealt with the engraving, etc. Yet all these individual craftsmen knew each other.</p>
<p>When a full armor was commissioned, one individual would go to each workshop and request the required pieces of the armor.</p>
<p>Only the Greenwich workshop made a full armor, but even in this workshop there was still a division of labor and various craftsmen were involved in the making of an armor.</p>
<p><strong>Hammering your piece</strong></p>
<p>You know your piece of metal is hot enough when its surface has turned incandescent (i.e. glowing/red hot) (image 99).</p>
<p>Use a vice grips / tangs to take the metal of the forge (do not do this with your hands: it is very HOT).</p>
<p>The benefit of the vice grips is that it will lock the metal piece, so it won’t drop. The downside is that it is hard to take off. The tangs will allow you to change grip easily.</p>
<p>Take the plate of the forge and place it on an anvil (tip: don’t use a glove on the hand you’re hammering with. You will have more grip without it. Only wear a glove on the hand you’re holding the tangs/metal with).</p>
<p>As Jeff says: Hammer like you mean it. Strike hard and with weight (image 100 &amp; image 101).</p>

<p><strong>Stretching and Raising </strong></p>
<p>Hammering hot metal straight onto the anvil is a technique called stretching.</p>
<p>Yet, you don’t necessarily have to hammer straight onto the anvil, you can also hammer hot metal into a hollow (image 102 and image 103) or over a ball stake (for example, when you’re making a helmet (image 104 &amp; image 105). This modern technique is called raising.</p>

<p><strong>Flaking/Scaling </strong></p>
<p>The more orange/red the metal, the softer it is, and the easier it will be to hammer. The downside however, is that it can flake/scale (image 106)</p>
<p>Because of this, the metal will get a bit lighter in the process of hammering.</p>

<p><strong>Hammering, light, and the senses / bodily experience</strong></p>
<p>Seconds after you’ve taken the metal out of the forge and started hammering, it will cool off and its red color will diminish (image 107). It is very important to pay attention to this, as the color of the metal will tell you how long you can keep hammering and when it is time to put it back into the forge/fire.</p>
<p>This is where the senses becomes important.</p>
<p>Jeff lamented the lighting in his workshop -- they had recently changed the brightness of the lights. The lights in the workshop were too bright. This was problematic for the process of hammering and shaping hot metal, where vision is very important.</p>
<p>Being able to recognize and observe the change of the metal’s color (and its diminishing incandescence/redness) is key to knowing if the metal is still hot enough for you to continue hammering. If the lighting is too bright, you cannot see (and thus determine) this properly. This is also why it is problematic to hammer hot metal outside in the sun(light).</p>
<p>It is also why blacksmith shops are usually rather dark(er).</p>
<p><em><strong>Question:</strong></em></p>
<p>Could this help explain why some paintings that depict the early modern process of metalworking at the forge (such as Brueghel’s <em>Allegory of Fire</em>) are usually rather dark?</p>
<p>Although using dark colors in paintings might on the one hand be a way for painters to create contrast and make fire stand out in their works, I wonder if that ‘darkness’ is also depicting <em>actual</em> artisanal practice and workshop settings?</p>
<p><em><strong>Answer Jeff Wasson:</strong></em> Yes! Absolutely. I would say that’s definitely the reason why.</p>

<p><strong>Tempering and quenching</strong></p>
<p>Tempering is the modern process of heat treating the metal in order to harden it, making it tougher.</p>
<p>You can use a blow torch for this (image 108). It is important to see the color of the metal when you are tempering or heat treating it, so you will have to clean your metal piece before you start.</p>
<p>When the metal reaches a certain temperature (but has not yet reached its critical point where it becomes incandescent), it will become magnetic (image 109). This is one way to check the temperature of the metal without having to use a thermometer.</p>
<p>When it becomes non-magnetic, it has reached its critical temperature (just before it will turn red-hot), which is when you need to quench the metal in oil or, as Jeff does, in a mixture of water and polymer.</p>
<p>It is important to cool off the metal slowly. If you cool it off too fast, the crystals in the metal will form in such a way that will toughen the metal, but will also make it brittle. Water is too aggressive.</p>
<p>Oil or the water-polymer mixture is better as this allows the metal to cool off slowly.</p>
<p>Jeff uses a water-polymer mixture instead of oil -- as they would have done in the middle ages -- as this doesn’t splash (as oil does).</p>
<p>Although, ideally, you want hard, tough armor, you don’t want it to go beyond that crucial point where it gets so hard that it gets brittle. It is therefore better to have metal be a bit more dense or softer, than to have it crack because you hardened it too much.</p>
<p><strong>Tempering and the senses</strong></p>
<p>One way of testing the toughness/hardness of metal is by means of a sound test. This is what they might have done in the middle ages.</p>
<p>They would use a file and rub it over the metal to listen to the kind of sound it produced. Hard, tempered metal sounds differently from non-tempered metal.</p>

<p><strong>Bluing/Coloring metal </strong></p>
<p>You can also use heat to color metal. This technique is called bluing.</p>
<p>The author-practitioner of the manuscript describes this technique as “faire passer”. See folio <a href="https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b10500001g/f198.image"><em>96v</em></a>.</p>
<p>There are various colors to achieve, each reached when the metal hits a certain temperature:</p>

<p>Purple: 550 degrees</p>
<p>Blue: 600-650 degrees</p>

<p>Colored metal can <em>partly</em> prevent rust and can last for years if you keep it in a dry place (and don’t let it get wet). You can protect the colored metal by coating it with wax or oil.</p>
<p>If you polish a colored piece of metal, you will rub of its color. Polishing colored armor is thus not possible -- at least not if you want it to retain its color.</p>
<p>The forge is too hot to color the metal. Jeff therefore uses a small blow torch (image 110).</p>
<p>By moving the flame of the torch back and forth as well as sideways under and over the piece of metal, you can change the material’s color (image 111; 112; 113).</p>
<p>Once the metal has reached the desired color, you need to quench it, to prevent it from passing beyond that point.</p>
<p>In the middle ages they probably used a forge or other heat source and then a second ‘chamber’ or ‘room’ or something like that to redirect the heat of the forge to. They could then use this second ‘chamber’/ ‘room’ to heat treat and color their metal.</p>
<p><strong>Question: </strong></p>
<p>Do we know when they first start making colored armor?</p>
<p><em><strong>Answer Jeff Wasson: </strong></em></p>
<p>It is very hard to say for sure since a lot of armor has been tampered with over the years. It is therefore sometimes difficult to know what the original looked like. This is why you need to look at art to get a better sense of when they started coloring armor (and what kinds of colors might have existed).</p>
<p><strong>Blackening </strong></p>
<p>Jeff also showed us a technique for blackening metal (see video no) (see image 114). Jeff does not believe they would have used this technique in the Middle Ages.</p>
<p>To blacken the metal, cover it in oil with a paper towel.</p>
<p>Then use a blow torch and move its flame back, forth and sideways over and under the metal to blacken the metal.</p>

<p>Now that the edges of your plate have the desired shape, it is time to add some volume to the clam. You can achieve this through dishing.</p>
<p>In order to shape or curve the metal, place your sheet on a woodblock with hollows in it (image 115 &amp; image 116) and push the metal into the hollow by hitting it with the hammer. Make sure that the sheet is making contact around the hollows. You can use vice grips to hold the metal, place it on the woodblock and prevent hammering on your fingers.</p>
<p>If you hit the metal in the right place, it will bent into the hollow of the wood and take on its shape (see the following images to view the curving of the metal: image 117; image 118; image 119; image 120)</p>
<p>As you can see in image 119, the black marker lines will disappear through (and in) the process of hammering.</p>

<p>After a while, the metal has reached its maximum curve. That is, you won’t be able to bent the metal further into the hollow. You can add more shape and volume to the plate by hammering it on a curved and ball stake (image 121; image 122; image 123; image 124). Note that on the curved stake, you need to hammer on the inside of the metal. What you’re doing is pushing the metal into the curvature of the stake. In contrast, with the ball stake, you need to hammer on the outside of the metal (i.e. where the grooves are). In doing so, you are hammering the metal <em>around</em> the ball stake, allowing the metal to take on its shape.</p>
<p>Once you have the desired shape, planish your piece to even out the irregularities.</p>
<p>If done correctly, the hammering should leave small little circles on the surface level of the metal (image 125).</p>
<p>See image 126, 127, 128 and 129 for the result.</p>
<p>The first part of your sword guard is now done!</p>

<p>The second part of the sword guard is the cross section, on top which I will attach the clam shaped metal.</p>
<p>To make this part, you need a long mild steel bar/rod.</p>
<p>As previously noted, make sure you’ve got your anvil and tools ready. Don’t forget to put on a glove (on the hand you’re not hammering with), safety goggles and ear protection.</p>
<p><strong>Flatten the end of the rod</strong></p>
<p>What we’re aiming to do is flatten (i.e. stretch) the end of the rod (image 130). You can do this by pushing the metal outwards by hitting it with a hammer when it is hot.</p>
<p>It is best to practice the hammering on the cold metal first, to become familiar with the technique of knowing where to hit the hot metal. In this way, you can be as efficient as possible when the metal comes out of the forge, and you won’t lose any valuable time.</p>
<p>To push the metal outward evenly at all sides, it is best to use the round side of the hammer.</p>
<p>When you think you’re ready, have organized your tools and have practiced the hammering enough, turn on the forge and place the end of the long steel rod/bar in the forge (image 131).</p>

<p>(6:40 pm: the iron rod has been in the forge for about 10 minutes, but is not red-hot.)</p>
<p>When the end of the bar is red hot, or incandescent, take it out of the forge and place it at the middle of the anvil.</p>
<p>Hammer on the glowing part repeatedly and with force until the metal is no longer red and has stopped glowing.</p>
<p>The amount of times you need to put the rod in the forge (and thus how often you need to hammer) depends on how much you can get the metal to move outwards at each turn. Since reheating the metal too often will cause it to become brittle, you want to be as efficient as possible when hammering. Hence, you need to hit the metal hard, with the utmost impact and at exactly the same spot.</p>
<p>See image 132 for how the metal rod is starting to flatten and image 133 for when the first end of the rod is flat enough.</p>
<p>When you’re done hammering, quench the end of the rod. Then hold it under running water, to get rid of excess heat.</p>

<p><strong>Flatten the center of the rod </strong></p>
<p>Next we had to turn the rod 90 degrees clockwise and flatter the center of the steel bar.</p>
<p>To determine the center of the rod, Jeff first placed the rod on the design we made of the sword guard to determine its total length (which he marked with drawing chalk). Then he determined the center of that piece and marked it for me with drawing chalk.</p>
<p>Since I had observed Jeff hammering the first end of the rod, it was now my turn to work the center. I first practiced hammering on the center of the rod before putting it in the forge again.</p>
<p>When I was comfortable and familiar enough with what had to be done, I placed the center/middle of the rod in the forge and waited for it to become incandescent.</p>
<p>Once red hot, I took it out of the forge and tried hitting the metal as hard as I could on its center (image 135) (image 136).</p>
<p>We had to repeat the process three times for the metal to flatten enough (image 137).</p>
<p><strong>Experience/reflection:</strong></p>
<p>I found practicing the hammering very useful. Not only did it add to my confidence that I could successfully flatten hot metal, but it also allowed me to gain somewhat more control over the technique. It was nevertheless very difficult to hit the metal consistently on the same spot and already after a few seconds of hammering my arm became heavy. Jeff told me that hammering the hot, and thus soft, metal would be much easier.</p>
<p>Interestingly, and just as Jeff Wasson had explained, hammering the red hot metal was indeed much easier. I felt more in control of my hammer(ing) and I could feel the metal move underneath the face of the tool. Upon striking the metal, I could also see small stardust or sparks flying off -- a result of the crystal structure of the metal and the impurities being pushed out by the hammering. This was almost mesmerizing to watch and the feeling and sight of the metal moving was incredible (almost empowering in itself)!</p>

<p>The next part is cutting the rod according to its required length (i.e. cutting it off at the chalk mark drawn previously).</p>
<p>You can do this with an angle grinder. To cut, first clamp your rod onto a piece of wood, making sure it can’t move. When secured, turn on the power tool and grind into the metal rod at the chalk line in a small up-and-down movement.</p>
<p>When you’ve cut through the rod and freed your ‘guard’ from the bar (image 141), bevel and debur the square edge (not those of the flattened end).</p>

<p>The next step is to flatten the other end of the steel rod (the end you just cut). However, in order to do so, it is best to have a handle, allowing you to have a better/proper grip over the bar.</p>
<p>Do to so, you have to weld the unworked, cut off rod to the previously flattened piece of steel.</p>
<p>Jeff has done this for me as this requires a tremendous amount of skill and time did not allow us to worry about teaching me this technique (image 143 and image 144).</p>
<p>Before doing this however, ALWAYS wear a special welding helmet (see image no) (even when you’re not the one doing the welding and are just observing). This is necessary because the light produced by the welding is so bright it can damage your eyes when looked at directly.</p>
<p>Check if there are no cracks in the glass before using this helmet. I also wore my safety goggles underneath the helmet, just to be sure.</p>

<p>The next step is to chisel grooves into the flattened (and outer) end of the guard (i.e. the one that is not welded onto the unworked rod). These grooves will resemble the ones in the clam shape, which will be attached to the rod later.</p>
<p>As with all other heating processes, it is best to practice before starting.</p>
<p>After the rod comes out of the fire (and is incandescent), you need to place (and hold) it at the center of the anvil. Someone else will then employ the chisel. The chisel will be placed onto the red hot part of the rod and hit on the chisel’s head with a hammer, thus carving lines into the material (image 146 &amp; 147).</p>
<p>You need to be extremely fast and hit the metal hard for a line to be imprinted into the material before it turns cold again.</p>
<p>When you’re done, you need to quench it and then hold it under running water.</p>
<p>Although we used a angle grinder to create the grooves in the clam shape, you can also employ this technique (i.e. chiseling), which is how early modern armor makers would have done it.</p>
<p>You can use the forge to heat up the metal, but since Jeff’s forge was in use at the moment we were about to do this, we used the blow torch instead.</p>
<p>Jeff employed the torch, while I held the steel rod’s end into its flames (image 145). When the metal turned red hot, Jeff turned off the torch, I swiftly placed the metal rod at the center of the anvil, so that Jeff could imprint the lines with a chisel and hammer.</p>

<p><strong>Making a hole for the sword</strong></p>
<p>When you’ve carved the lines into the rod’s end, use the same technique to hit a form the size of a sword’s hole into the material.</p>
<p>To do this first place your clam shape onto the center of the rod and use drawing chalk to trace the contours of the clam’s hole onto the rod (image 148)</p>
<p>Then find (or make as Jeff did) a chisel whose tail follows the contours of that hole precisely.</p>
<p>Next employ the same technique used to carve the grooves into the metal to mark the lines of hole into the steel rod (image 149)</p>
<p>Jeff noticed however, that the steel was too hard and thick to punch through with the chisel and he therefore used a drill to ‘cut’ the hole out of the metal (image 150).</p>
<p>Clamp your guard between a vice and use a file to get rid of the burs and sand the edges of the hole.</p>

<p>Next you need to cut the guard free from the steel rod. To do so, place the rod on a piece and clamp it into place with a vice grip/clamps. Then grind into the metal, alongside the flattened and welded piece with an angle grinder, freeing the guard from the rod (image 151 and image 152).</p>
<p>To get rid of the welded residue, bevel and sand the edges with the belt sander.</p>

</ul>
<p>The next step in the process is to bend/curve the ends of the guard in opposite direction. To do this, you need to reheat the ends (using either the forge or the blow torch.</p>
<p>Again: practice/run through the steps/process before you begin!</p>
<p>When you have heated the metal, place it on the outer edge of a round anvil (image 153) and hit the metal with the hammer around its curvature, so that it will take on the anvil’s shape. N.B. Before the metals cools off, however, quickly place it on the rounded edge of a regular anvil’s face, just after the metal has taken on the shape of the round anvil (image 153). This will allow you to straighten the curve somewhat (image 154).</p>
<p>Then bevel and sand all the edges of the guard with the belt sander.</p>
<p>If you prefer you can also give your piece a polished finish by polishing it with the belt sander (image 155 &amp; 156). Be careful no to sand into the curves too much, as you don’t want to remove the grooves.</p>
<p>When you’re done, you will have finished the two separate pieces of your sword guard (image 157)!</p>

<p>The final step of the process is to attach the two separate pieces of the guard together.</p>
<p>You can do this by means of a technique called riveting. To attach the two pieces together, however, you first need to create two holes into the horizontal piece by aligning it with the holes in the clam.</p>
<p>You can do this by placing the clam on top (at the center) of the rod and tracing/carving the contours of the holes with an awl into the rod (if they are not visible enough, you can also create a divot with a center punch first). Then drill out the holes.</p>
<p>Next, place your clam on the rod (aligning the holes) and put a rivet (bottom/tail up; i.e. sticking out of the top of the rod) in the holes. Place the rod on an anvil while holding the pieces aligned. Then hammer several times with the round face of a hammer onto the end of the divet. This will cause the rivet’s tail to stretch/flatten/push out over the rod, securing it into place (images 158 &amp; 159).</p>
<p>Your sword guard is now DONE (image 160; image 161; image 162; image 163; image 164)!</p>
<p>Next step: varnishing!!</p>
