<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><blockquote>
<p>Practice and experiment with making molds of bread based on recipes from BnF Ms. Fr. 640.</p>

<li><blockquote>
<p>Become familiar with interpreting early modern recipes (such as those in the BnF Ms. Fr 640) and learn how to document reconstructions in written form.</p>

<li><blockquote>
<p>Learn how to use a variety of resources and tools to find and select early modern recipes.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Reflect on materials and their nature.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ol>
<p>I chose not to put my starter’s kit in the refrigerator, given that early modern practitioners also did not have the luxury of one and had to resort to other ways to keep their sourdough cold (if desired). I therefore decided to keep it in on an open shelved closet (see fig. 2) adjacent to the kitchen but secluded from its daily activities (and thus from the heat produced during them).</p>

<p><strong>Location:</strong> Private apartment, 405 West 118th Street, 10027 New York.</p>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Searching for how to feed starter and early modern bread-making recipes</p>
<p><strong>Feeding starter:</strong></p>
<p>I found instructions for feeding my starter’s kit on the website ‘Cultures for Health’:</p>
<p><em>https://www.culturesforhealth.com/learn/sourdough/how-to-feed-sourdough-starter/</em></p>
<p><strong><em>REFLECTIONS:</em></strong></p>
<p>I did not have time to start with the bread-making assignment until about four days after we were given the starter’s kit. The fact that my kit was left untouched (and unrefrigerated) for a number of days made me wonder if this would have any effect on the outcome of the reconstruction.</p>
<p><strong>Searching for Early Modern recipes:</strong></p>
<p>I started by using the Recipes’ Project website to look for possible reference to bread making: <a href="https://recipes.hypotheses.org/"><em>https://recipes.hypotheses.org/</em></a></p>
<p>Because I was unsuccessful, I decided to use the <a href="http://guides.library.columbia.edu/HIST-G8906"><em>CU library tool</em></a> developed by Meredith Levin.</p>
<p>After having consulted the ‘Cooking’ tab, I used the ‘Finding Recipes’ - ‘Online Databases with Recipes’ option. I used two different databases from that list:</p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p><a href="http://eeb.chadwyck.com/home.do"><em>Early European Books:</em></a> printed sources to 1700:</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I struggled with getting hits and therefore moved on to try:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p><a href="http://guides.library.columbia.edu/c.php?g=202887&amp;p=1369201"><em>Early English Books Online</em></a>:</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>I first searched for recipes with ‘bread’ ranging from 1500-1700. This gave me a huge list of hits that contained a wide variety of books of mainly religious meaning.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>I therefore chose to use ‘cooking’ and subsequently ‘cook’ as a keyword and found the following books:</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Mrs. A. M. - <em>Cookery refin'd. Or, The lady, gentlewoman and servant-maids useful companion </em></strong>(1656)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Browsing through it, however, makes clear the book is only about Meat, Fish and Poultry. No references to bread making.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Mounsieur [sic] Marnètte</strong> - <em>The Perfect Cook</em> (1656)</p>
<p>The word bread is used 96 times throughout the book. Although the book often mentions ‘household bread’, it is always used as an ingredient or tool in the context of other recipes. No references to making bread.</p>
<p><strong>Hannah Woolley - <em>The accomplisht ladys delight in preserving, physick and cookery</em> (1675)</strong></p>
<p>Contains recipes for making ginger-bread and brisket bread, but no ‘plain’ bread (although I am now wondering to what extent this matters for molding)</p>
<p><strong>Robert May - The accomplisht cook, or The art and mystery of cookery (1665)</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Contains a recipe on ‘To make French Bread the best way’. This book uses the word</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘bread’ 372 times. Yet there are only 2 or 3 recipes for actually making bread. I chose to make “French Bread the best way”.</p>

<p><strong>Transcription:</strong><br />
Take a gallon of fine flour, and a pint of good new ale barn or yeast, and put it to the floor, with the whites of six new laid eggs well beaten in a dish, and mixt with the barn in the middle of the flour, also three spoonfuls of fine salt, then warm some milk and fair water, and put to it, and make it up pretty stiff, being well wrought and worked up, cover it in a boul or tray with a warm cloth till your be hot, then make it up either in rouls, or fashion it in little wooden dishes and bake it, being baked in a quick oven, chip it hot.</p>
<p><strong><em>REFLECTIONS:</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p><strong>Search tool:</strong> Using the database search tool was extremely useful, but it does require practice to know which keywords best to use and how to employ them in such a way that allows you to narrow your search result to a searchable amount of hits (as opposed to 40 pages).</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p><strong>Use of bread in recipes:</strong> It is both as a result of my browsing through the BnF. Ms. Fr. 640 and the recipe books online, that I learned bread was a commonly used ingredient/material and tool in the production of other recipes. There are numerous instructions to ‘cover with bread’, ‘put on bread’, ‘mix with grated bread’, ‘use white bread’, etc. But little to no recipes for actually making bread. My guess is that it is precisely because bread was so frequently used that authors of recipe books presumably did not consider it worthy of documenting -- unless they knew of an excellent way to prepare it (and could possibly distinguish themselves from other authors).</p>

</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Later added comment</em>: In her annotation ‘Pain, Ostie, Rostie Bread in Early Modern Europe’ of 2016, Emma Marie Le Pouésard has also pointed to the important role of bakers’ guilds in the production of bread. This might also explain why there are few recipes on how to make bread in early modern recipe books.</p>

<p>One of the limitations of selecting materials was the amount of time I had.

<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Feeding starter</p>
<p><strong>11:02 PM</strong> I mixed half a cup of starter with half a cup of water and about 1 cup of flower. I stirred it all and made sure no flour was stuck on the bottom of the bowl or on the sides (see image below). I covered it with a cloth and put it in the same uncovered closet as the sourdough starter’s kit.</p>
<p><strong>11:15</strong> <strong>PM</strong> Set my sourdough to rest overnight and will refeed it tomorrow morning.</p>
<p><strong><em>REFLECTIONS:</em></strong></p>
<p>I found it somewhat difficult to know how much starter to use given that I would like to make at least two loaves. I might have been too frugal with my starter.</p>

<p>Sourdough has risen a bit but is not bubbling yet (see image) as I had hoped. Only two small bubbles have appeared on the surface. There might be various reasons for this:</p>

</ul>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><blockquote>
<p>I didn’t put enough starter in the mix and I was too frugal with it (which was already one of my concerns)</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>It became active overnight – I didn’t see it – and then settled down again because it wasn’t fed.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>The temperature in my room and nature of my sourdough is simply different from the one in the instruction video and I need to let it sit longer.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Leaving my starter unrefrigerated for a fews days has ‘deactivated’ (for lack of a better word) the bacteria in the starter.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>I decided to move the sourdough mix to a slightly warmer location (in the kitchen cupboard) for about four hours and see if it would become more active.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>If not, the internet informs me that I can mix in a little more starter. For now, I will try to be patient.</p>
<p>I have also moved the starter to the fridge; thinking about the objectives, I reckon it is more important to be able to experiment with making the molds than have the process of preparing the starter be as authentic as possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong><em>REFLECTIONS:</em></strong></p>
<p>My experience made me aware of the messiness, open-endedness and situatedness of craft practices. It illustrated to me that reconstructions (and processes of making more generally), differ fundamentally from reading a set of written instructions, in the sense that knowing how to proceed is not merely a matter of following an <em>a priori</em> laid out plan (no matter how well-organised and thought out), but rather, depends on decisions, solutions and adjustments that have to be made impromptu, in situ, in the face of (sometimes) unforeseen problems and thus in the unfolding of the process itself. This requires an empirical mode of reasoning.</p>

<ul>

<p>I have begun to realize there is a benefit of choosing a glass or see through box/bowl when making your starter: the ability of sight and seeing the texture of the mixture through the glass (knowing if there are bubbles inside). On the other hand, I am also thinking of Pamela Smith’s and Tianna Uchacz’ comment about how we tend to rely a lot on sight, whereas early modern practitioners would also employ other senses to know if, for example, water was boiling or materials would be ready for use in a subsequent step of the making process.</p>

<p><strong>Selecting Amounts: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>After doing some internet research, I found that a gallon of flower would be about 16 cups. This recipe was probably intended for a large group of people, or for make various batches of bread from. I chose to work with less. I tried finding out how much flower an average sized bread at that time would have required, but did not succeed.I thus checked a modern-day bread recipe and used it as a comparative (although I realize this will make my reconstruction less authentic).</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<p>I found a recipe for sourdough bread making on the same website that I used for</p>
<p>learning how to feed my starter. This recipe uses 3-⅓ cups of flower. I decided to use 4</p>
<p>cups (for easier Math).</p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>As I divided my flour by four, I did this for the other ingredients as well. I wanted to make two batches of bread, so decided to change the amount of egg-whites in the second trial, to see what it would to do to the texture of the bread (I reasoned that egg-whites normally make a something fluffier).</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>The recipe calls for “some milk and fair water”. As the author does not specify the amount, I chose to use water and milk by discretion, and see how much I would need in the process of making the dough.</p>

“Take a gallon of fine flour, and a pint of good new ale barn or yeast, and put it to the floor, with the whites of six new laid eggs well beaten in a dish, and mixt with the barn in the middle of the flour, also three spoonfuls of fine salt, then warm some milk and fair water, and put to it, and make it up pretty stiff, being well wrought and worked up, cover it in a boul or tray with a warm cloth till your oven be hot, then make it up either in rouls, or fashion it in little wooden dishes and bake it, being baked in a quick oven, chip it hot.”</p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>We mixed 1-½ egg whites in a semi-deep plate with a fork until we thought it was ‘well beaten’</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>We put four cups of flour on the table.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>We made a hollow in the flour and added :<br />
- ½ cup of starter</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>- 1-½ egg whites<br />
- ¾ tablespoon of salt</p>
<p>(see image)</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>We mixed it all together. It was still very dry and needed liquid in order for the flour to form a ball of dough.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>We mixed ¾ cup of water and ¼ cup of milk and briefly warmed it up on the stove (in a pan). We reasoned that “some milk and fair water” meant more water than milk and decided to start with ¾ cups of water and ¼ cups of milk and add more, if needed (i.e. by discretion).</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>We poured the warm milk-water mixture gradually over the flour (in a hollow we created). Everytime the liquid had been absorbed by the flour mixture, we poured in some more.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>The dough was really sticky (see image). My (Celine’s) mom always taught me that dough is ready when it doesn’t stick to your hands or the table anymore. Although we didn’t know if that rule applied to early modern dough as well, we figured it would have made sense to apply it nevertheless. Having to move the sticky mixture into a bowl for rising would have been impossible.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>We thus added about half a cup more flour</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>The dough was now no longer sticking to our hands (or the table).</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>We knead the dough by folding it and throwing it on the table (as my mom always did when she made bread -- according to her, this would allow air to go in, making it puffy).</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>We figured this might have been what the author of the recipe meant with ‘well wrought and worked up’. We did so for about 5-10 minutes.</p>

<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Letting the dough rise</p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>We shaped the bread in a ball and put it in a bowl, covered with a damp linen cloth. We had a brief discussion about the meaning of “warm cloth”. Does the author mean warm as in ‘thick’ (less air going through and thus of a more isolating nature) or warm as in temperature of the cloth? Moreover, in case of the latter, does he mean warm being heated by the warmth of the stove, or warm being damp (as a result of warm water)? I interpreted it as meaning the latter, on the basis of my own experience with baking bread. I know yeast responds well to damp/warm areas. So we dampened the cloth with warm water and covered the bowl with it.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>As per instructions, we had to let the bread rise “till our oven be hot”. We realized that it would be difficult to know how long and at which temperature we would have to set the oven. How long would it have taken for early modern ovens to be hot? This might in part depend on the kind of oven that was used for baking bread.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>As we didn’t have much time to do proper research on this, we chose to follow the light of Yasemin’s oven as an indicator. As most modern recipes for making bread require a temperature of about 350-400 Fahrenheit, we decided to go with that and set our oven at 350 Fahrenheit.</p>

<p>cast it as large as it is. But, if you want to let it shrink, let it dry to a greater or lesser extent.&lt;/ab&gt;</p>

<p>the relief in &lt;m&gt;gold&lt;/m&gt; or &lt;m&gt;silver&lt;/m&gt; or any other metal you would like. But to make this process go faster, if you are in a hurry, make the first impression and the</p>

<p><strong><em>MAKING THE MOLDS </em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>As the author-practitioner considers the bread just out of the oven the best for molding, we did not wait for the bread to cool off.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>The recipe instructs us to use the ‘pith’ of the bread. We assumed this was the inner part of the bread.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>We thus cut the bread in half. However, although the color looked nice, the crust was too hard and it took a lot of bodily effort to cut through it. We realized leaving the bread in for an hour might have been too long. Although we also reasoned it might be difficult to find the cause of the hard crust (the temperature might have been too high, there may not have been enough water/milk, egg whites, yeast, etc. in it).</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>This in itself pointed to the experimental nature of reconstructions. Gaining a better understanding of which variables need to be altered to create a desired effect or, which variables collectively produced a certain result, demands and invites experimentation and experience. That is, we would have to try numerous variations of the recipe in order to find out what <em>might</em> have caused the bread to become so dry (accepting that we might never find out).</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>The inside contained quite a lot of air pockets. We used one side of the mold to press in a pair of scissors (the object we chose to mold -- for lack of something better).</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>We felt it was rather spongy and it bounced back, not really taking on the shape of the scissors properly.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>We noticed that the bread dried rather quickly once taken out off the oven.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>This is probably why the author practitioner advises to use bread directly from the oven.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>It is thus through <em>making</em> the molds—as opposed to reading about how to make them— that I came to better understand the recipe and the author’s instructions.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>We thus decided to try a different technique with the other side of the bread (before it would dry out too much).</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Instead of directly pressing the object in the bread, we decided to try and scoop out the ‘pith’ of the bread and use that as the mold within which to press our object.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>This turned out to be impossible (at least with bread having just come out of the oven) as the bread was still very hot, causing us to burn our fingers (see how red my hands are in the image below).</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>This is why we reasoned the author-practitioner probably didn’t mean for molds to be made in this manner.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>We let the scissors sit in the bread for a while and see if it would take on its shape better after a while. In the meantime we started making preparations for trial two.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>After about 5 minutes we took the scissor out of the first mold. The scissors were lying on the mold’s surface, and the pit had not really taken in any clear imprint of the object.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The bread was too dry and not absorbent enough. We also thought there were too many air pockets, which probably ‘ruined’ the imprint and its details.</p>

<p><strong><em>REFLECTIONS </em></strong></p>
<p>Our first experiment made us realize that although the golden-colored bread might have tasted (and looked) good, it was not suitable for our purposes (i.e. as the basis for making molds).</p>
<p>This meant that we could not rely on the crust or taste of the bread as an indication of what ‘good’ bread was (in the context of bread molding) and when it should be taken out of the oven.</p>
<p>Yet we are so used to thinking about bread (and good bread) in terms of food and thus the way it looks (golden brown, crispy crust, not too dense, but rather puffy and with air pockets), and feels/tastes in our mouths, that it is easy to forget that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. Our pallets might have changed over time and early modern individuals might have had</p>
</blockquote>
<p>different preferences and thoughts on what ‘good’ bread looked and tasted like. Since the</p>
<p>author practitioner does not explain what kind of texture would be most suitable for the</p>
<p>bread, it thus seems reasonable to assume that the natural texture of early modern bread</p>
<p>(i.e. how it was commonly prepared) might have lend itself very well for molding purposes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2. Bread was used for different purposes in the early modern period and was not merely a</p>
<p>source of nutrition. This is reflected by the various uses of bread in the manuscript.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Making a good mold thus required us to think about bread beyond its nutritional purposes and instead to imagine what other kind of qualities would have rendered it suitable for molding.</p>
<p>Put differently, this meant we had to think of bread in terms of it being used for molding and determine what good bread was within that specific context.</p>
<p>Focusing on the crust, would not be very useful in that case.</p>
<p>Yet if not for the crust, how else were we to determine what good bread was?</p>

<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>We chose to use 2 egg whites this time, instead of 1-½, to see if it this would create less air pockets and create a more dense texture and even surface. We beat them in a semi-deep plate with a fork until we believed they were ‘well beaten’.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>We put 4-½ cups of flour on the table (having learned in our first trial that we needed more flour).</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>We made a hollow in the flour and added:<br />
- ½ cup of starter</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>- 2 egg whites<br />
- ¾ tablespoon of salt</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>We mixed it all together. As before, it was still very dry and needed liquid in order for the flour to form a proper ball.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>We mixed ¾ cup of water and ¼ cup of milk and briefly warmed it up on the stove (in a pan).</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>We poured the warm milk-water mixture gradually over the flour (in a hollow we created). Every time the liquid had been absorbed by the flour mixture, we poured in some more.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Probably because of the extra ½ egg whites, the dough was still too sticky and needed more flower. So we added about half a cup.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>The dough was now no longer sticking to our hands (or the table).</p>

<p>It still hadn’t risen a lot. There probably wasn’t a sufficient amount of yeast in the dough.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>However, more yeast would probably also cause more air pockets, which we believed would interfere with and ruin the shape and details of an object’s imprint.

<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Baking the bread, trial 2</p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>We set the oven temperature a bit higher this time (at about 400F), but chose not leave the bread in as long as in trial 1. We hoped this would allow for a sufficient crust to be formed which would keep the bread in one piece when picking it up, while leaving the inside (the pith) still moist enough to be absorbent to an object (without too runny and thus swallowing it whole).</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Key to this experiment was therefore no longer the crust, like it had been before, but rather the pith of the bread. How were we to make sure the texture of the pith was in fact suitable for molding without cutting it open and running the risk of drying it out? We recalled that bakers sometimes stick chopsticks in their cakes to check if they’re done. If there is no cake batter sticking to the chopsticks, it means the cake has the right texture and can be taken out of the oven. We decided to make use of that trick (see the small holes in the bread in the picture below) and take the bread out once the dough would no longer stick to the chopsticks.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>After about 20 minutes we checked the inside of the bread. Dough still stuck to the chopsticks, so we left it in the oven a bit longer.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>After another 10 minutes had passed (total: 30 minutes), we stuck the chopsticks back in again. No dough stuck to the sticks. We thus took the bread out of the oven.</p>

<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Making the molds, trial 2</p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Once we had cut the bread, it turned out the pith was still very runny (we probably hadn’t stuck our chopsticks in deep enough), so it probably should have stayed in the oven a bit longer (we wrote this down as a reminder for our next attempt). However we decided to give the molding a go nevertheless. Having learned from our previous trial—and hence from experience—that the bread dried pretty quickly, we hoped the inside would solidify a bit after having cooled off.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>We saw few to no air pockets, so we assumed the ratio of ingredients was good.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>We pressed a pair of scissors in the pith of the bread.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>After a few minutes, we noticed the bread had swallowed my entire scissors. The texture of the bread was too moist (i.e. too absorbent to an object) and was thus not suitable for molding—we probably should have left it in longer (or changed the temperature).</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>We realized however, that the outer regions (for lack of a better word) of the bread, might be less runny (because they are not as thick), so we cut of a large slice at the outer part of the bread and pressed another pair of scissors into them (see image with red )</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>This worked remarkably well.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>We left it in for about 20 minutes.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>After trial 1 &amp; 2 we thus ended up with three different kind of molds (see image):</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Mold 1: Did not take on an imprint very well. We had to use quite a lot of pressure to get an imprint of some sort and only the contours of the scissors were visible. Too many air pockets and a too dry and not moist enough texture prevented the bread from taking on any details.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Mold 2: Too runny. Too absorbent to anything. Swallowed the entire object. Impossible to use as a mold as it would not have any fixed contours (later added comment: even after several hours, the bread was still damp and soft).</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Mold 3: Turned out really well. Few to no air pockets, which allowed for clear outlines/contours of the scissors. All lines and details visible. Texture perhaps a bit too dry for the scissors to be pressed further down into the bread -- the imprint/hollow is rather shallow. Any liquid that would be poured in would probably run over.</p>

<p>In the beginning I focused heavily on the recipe’s instruction and I was measuring the ingredients carefully. E.g. making sure I used enough egg-whites, enough flower, not too much milk. In other words, the textual instructions were central to my ability to move forward in the process.</p>
<p>But over time, after having gained more experience in making bread, those instructions became less important. Rather central to the process was now <em>my own body</em>.</p>
<p>For example, I referred to my own memory of what the dough <em>felt</em> like in the last trial, to determine whether or not I should add more or less flower, if it required water or perhaps another egg white.</p>
<p>I thus began to think of my own body as a repository of memory and of being capable of storing sensory memories of materials, their properties, their textures, etc. E.g., how does dough <em>feel</em> on my hands and fingers when it is ‘ready’ to be put aside and to let rise? Is it sticky? It is malleable? How does it <em>sound</em> when I slap it onto the table? How does it <em>feel</em> when I slide the chopstick into the bread, is there resistance or does it go in smoothly?</p>
<p>This also made me think differently about some of the entries in the manuscript where the author refers to bread as a comparative material (as opposed to being an ingredient). For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p><strong>fol. 29r:</strong> “And knead it as if you wanted to make &lt;m&gt;bread&lt;/m&gt;”</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p><strong>fol. 29r:</strong> “you perceive that it has enough body &amp; is as firm as &lt;m&gt;bread dough&lt;/m&gt;”</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p><strong>fol. 114r:</strong> “Then strongly separate the molds as if you wanted to tear &lt;m&gt;bread&lt;/m&gt; apart”</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p><strong>fol. 129v:</strong> “then dry them into an oven as hot as when &lt;m&gt;bread&lt;/m&gt; has been taken out.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p><strong>fol. 129v:</strong> “promptly dry them in an oven as warm as when &lt;m&gt;bread&lt;/m&gt; has been taken out”</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<p>The ability for any practitioner to follow this set of instructions is fundamentally dependent on his familiarity with the process of making bread, bread dough, tearing bread, using an oven, etc.</p>
<p>Most importantly, it is not a fixed set of instructions, but rather the materiality of the bread itself and the bodily memories of it (as experienced through the practitioner’s own bodily engagement with the material) that becomes central to understanding and knowing, when and how to move forward in the experiment.</p>
<p>Your bodily engagement with the material, and most importantly the sensory memory of it, as experienced through and subsequently stored in your body, is thus the guiding principle.</p>
<p>What went along with this was the fact that I didn’t write much down either. Whereas in the first two trials I was jotting down every single gram and change of oven temperature, I had now become more confident in relying on my own judgement for knowing if the dough or the bread was ready.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to reflect more on the act of note taking and its relation to the amount of experience one has in executing a certain experiment.</p>

<p>Today it was time to cast beeswax and sulfur into our molds.</p>
<p>I had brought 6 molds: 4 single piece molds and one two-piece mold. Unfortunately the last mold of the scissors had started to mold (no pun intended) and it had begun to smell, so I had to throw it out.</p>
<p>I thus proceeded with 4 molds and 1 double sided mold, each with an imprint of my contact case.</p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>We had to find a way to attach the two sides of the two-piece mold together. Because my bread mold was a bit wonky on the sides, we used non-hardening molding clay (plasticine) to elevate the sides and piece the mold together with the expert help of Naomi. We also used the plasticine to seal the holes in the bread mold.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>It was difficult to know how much plasticine to use or if would hold and prevent the wax/sulfur from running out.</p>

<ul>

<p>The large part of my bread molds came of rather easily. I could tear off large chunks of bread with relative ease. I am not sure if this may be due to the bread’s texture--it was still fairly humid/moist (I deliberately undercooked the bread)--or if the linseed oil had anything to do with this. This would require multiple experimentations and variations of the casting.</p>

<p>The tricky part, however, was to remove the remaining bread crumbs that stuck to the sulfur and the beeswax, so as to get a clean cast. This proved easier with the ones made of sulfur. Although this material was more brittle and prone to breaking (one of the two casts was too fragile and broke in half) than the casts made from beeswax, its hardness actually enabled me to remove the crumbs with a toothpick, without (noticeably) carving away the sulfur and thus adding a new and unintended pattern to the cast or removing/altering the existing one.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Although, in theory, the toothpick method could have worked for the beeswax casts as well, practice showed that this tool actually left carvings in the wax (because of the properties of the wax) and thus altered the end result. I therefore tried removing the bread crumbs by soaking the beeswax casts in water and by softly rubbing them of with my fingers, but it remained difficult to remove them all.</p>
