<p><em>Thoughts/Observations:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p><strong>On Mistakes:</strong> On one hand, I was glad that the accident occurred, as it showed me the impact of vinegar coming into contact with the copper plate after some verdigris had grown. This allowed me to compare the behaviour of verdigris growth left untouched vs. disturbed by vinegar solution. Indeed, this made me understand why various verdigris recipes (see compilation <a href="http://www.vastrepast.net/www.vastrepast.net/From_Dirt_to_Shirt/Entries/2010/5/31_Making_Verdigris.html"><em>here</em></a>) emphasized on not letting the copper come into contact with vinegar. It also showed me the different shades of green-blue that could be produced, and why the Ms Fr 640 made a note on his process to create a “beautiful green” (vs. one that has a blackish tint, as mine did)</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
  <p>I wonder however, if that contact with vinegar also affected verdigris growth on other parts of the copper sheet… Looking at some of my classmates’ pictures, my verdigris growth was not as thick (see for instance, Nancy’s fieldnotes <a href="http://fieldnotes.makingandknowing.org/2018-Fall/Olson-Verdigris_Field_Notes_FA18/Olson-Verdigris_Field_Notes_FA18.html"><em>here</em></a>), though it was quite even in its growth.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p><strong>On Environment:</strong> I had left my verdigris on my kitchen rack undisturbed and away from direct sunlight, only moving it to take pictures for my field notes. The recipes (Liber Coloribus and The Secrets of Master Alexis of Piemont) called for it to “put it in a warm place” or “underground” i.e. away from the sun, vs. Mappae Clavicula’s recipe that called for it to put it “under the sun” (see recipes <a href="http://www.vastrepast.net/www.vastrepast.net/From_Dirt_to_Shirt/Entries/2010/5/31_Making_Verdigris.html"><em>here</em></a>). While I tried my best to replicate conditions of the former, the changing seasonality would have let to varied temperatures in the kitchen. I also wonder if artificial light would have affected verdigris growth as well. I am also curious to see how the former recipes may compare with Clavicula’s - how does lighting and temperature affect verdigris growth? Is it an either/or (dark or light) or do varying degrees of brightness and temperature have different effects on the verdigris?</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p><strong>On Taking Field Notes</strong>: It was much harder to remind myself to document changes in my verdigris over a period of time, especially when there isn’t any distinct next step of the process or any need to tell when it’s done. Also I realize that most of the time I’m more inclined to document any changes to the verdigris, but I think there’s also value in documenting a <em>lack</em> of change over a period of time, as that too says something perhaps about the % of acid, the conditions for verdigris growth, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>I also found pictures in this set of field notes more important than text since most of my entries were noting down my visual observations. I therefore could not use words really to describe my actions. Also I struggled with precision in my terminology (eg. “green-blue”) in capturing the exact shade/change in the verdigris, since everyone’s conception of colour is different — this made pictures even more important for me.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p><strong>On Verdigris Itself:</strong> The process of growing verdigris took longer than expected. The preparatory process of painting/dyeing must have taken a while if verdigris was not commercially available / if the craftsmen somehow had no access to it.</p>
