<p>After receiving a linoleum block I chose a design and began the process of cutting it out in the linoleum block. It was initially somewhat difficult to get a good sense of the necessary amount of pressure and the angle at which to cut into the block, but I had gained a better sense of both by the end of the session. Given the complexity of the pattern I had chosen, I also found it somewhat difficult to keep track of the thin, curling lines I would have to leave as I cut out blank spaces on the block.</p>

<p>I continued to work on the linoleum block without any major changes from the first session. As I did so, I gained greater familiarity with the tools and techniques needs to cut into the block, though the rather fine and complicated pattern continued to pose somewhat of a challenge.</p>

<p>Finishing the linoleum cut, I came to some of the more detailed work, gaining an awareness of how difficult it could be to cut small patterns into the linoleum.</p>

<p>Having only had time to cut a basic grid into my copper plate, I began by sanding the plate to remove any fragments and then beveled the edges so that it could be printed without ripping through the paper. Next, I polished the copper until it was clean and dried it. I then applied ink to the plate and worked it into the indentations. Afterward, I cleaned the surface of the plate, placed it on the press and printed on a handmade sheet of paper. The basic grid design came out quite clearly. Finishing the process, I used soap to clean the block of ink.</p>
