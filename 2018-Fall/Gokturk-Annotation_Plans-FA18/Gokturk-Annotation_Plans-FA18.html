<p>Translation (tl_p142v, Fall 2018)</p>
<h2 id="molding-grasshoppers-and-things-too-thin"><strong>Molding grasshoppers and things too thin</strong></h2>
<p>If you have a written paper to mold, which is too thin, after you have made the first cast &amp; it has set, give a little thickness to the reverse of your paper with melted butter, which is the most appropriate means there is, &amp; for fortifying the wings of either a butterfly or a grasshopper, or some delicate part of an animal to which you need to give thickness. But take heed to apply this melted butter underneath the wing or in whichever place it cannot be seen. For giving thickness to a pansy or other flowers, butter is not good, but rather wheat oil, which is soon dry &amp; holds firm. Wax would not be appropriate here for it is too hot once melted, &amp; it makes the thing to which it is applied contract. But butter is amiable and handleable.</p>
<p>If you write on paper or on common carton &amp; that your letter is with gum, the humidity of the clay slab or the wet sand for noyau will moisten your letter {&amp;} undo it. Therefore write with cinnabar wettened with oil, on oiled paper &amp;impress.</p>
<p><strong>2-OVERVIEW:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Focus:</strong>Reconstruct Molded Letter and Paper (fol. 131r). Refer to 2 previous annotations (Carlson/Katz,2014, Fu and Zhang, 2015) on the subject.</p>
<p>1-Try to expand on the following aspects of the reconstruction:</p>
<p>-The tools used</p>
<p>-The consistency, strength and viscosity of the ink “bien gommee”:</p>
<p>a-by adding ingredients to the iron gall ink based on the ink recipes of the period</p>
<p>b-by experimenting gum (gum arabic, gum tragacanth) ratio to increase both fluidity and thickness of the ink</p>
<p>-The casting in tin and lead, previously done by Fu and Zhang with poor results</p>
<p>-The meaning of casting both sides</p>
<p>2-Try to ask questions and explore from the point of view of historical research:</p>
<p>a-the purpose and uses of such recipe in the period</p>
<p>b-handwriting and signatures as extension of the hand, the body and the identity of artist/artisan</p>
<p>c-the idea of capturing a gesture as opposed to a living thing outside of the body. capturing the self in the act of making/creating, a gesture that is extension of the body. Turning fluid into static</p>
<p>d-its relation to casting things too thin, and casting things from life-dead things.</p>
<p><strong>3-RECONSTRUCTION:</strong></p>
<p>Reconstruct the recipe using 131r and referencing both Jordan/Katz and Fu/Zhang annotations.</p>
<p>Cast the outcome using</p>
<p><strong>a-materials:</strong></p>
<p>-gum tragacanth</p>
<p>-gum arabic</p>
<p>-iron gall ink</p>
<p>-cotton/hemp paper</p>
<p>-clay</p>
<p>-brandy</p>
<p><strong>b-outline of reconstruction:</strong><br />
1-I will prep the paper by oiling it with wheat germ oil<br />
2-I will boil the iron gall ink and add glass-powder, powdered charcoal, oak gall and dried fish dust to strengthen the ink<br />
3-I will mix the ink with gum tragacanth and also with gum arabic to achieve “well-gummed” ink<br />
4-I will try using a quill, and a variety of brushes shooting for the thickest yet fluid viscosity I can achieve.<br />
5-I will spell out “BODY” on the paper.<br />
5-I will let it dry overnight<br />
6-I will prepare a slab of clay to press onto.<br />
7-I will press the writing onto the plasticine<br />
<br />
In the lab: Casting Using Tin/Lead Alloy<br />
1-I will melt one part tin/one part led in the pot under fume hood.<br />
2-I will pour it onto the clay mold.</p>
<p><strong>MANUSCRIPT RESEARCH of MATERIALS:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Paper:</strong> I am provided with historic paper from the lab.</p>
<p><strong>Ink:</strong> The recipe doesn’t specify ink. Jordan/Katz used iron gall ink. The manuscript has one mention of oil-based ink recipe, mentioning it peripherally.</p>
<p><strong>Cutters of printing plates_51r</strong></p>
<p>To clean the copper plates, or to have worn ones print better, boil them for four or five good hours in a good lye with lye which is quite spent. Then make your ink with some linseed oil &amp; not with walnut oil &amp; press with the rollers. The copper plates are sooner made than wood blocks, but they are not so appropriate for printing promptly. The wood ones are laborious but also will sooner have printed twenty sheets than the other will have done two. To carve in wood, the secret is firstly to poach, that is to say to lay the counterproof or drawn piece onto the wood block &amp; to make sure that the side with the traced line is stuck to the wood. Once dry, you then gently rub with a moist handkerchief the back of the paper which, by rubbing, will become so delicate that almost only the line will remain, which, next, one follows in cutting the surface. You could do this with historiated glass &amp; coat with noir d’escaille, to then scrape &amp; layer your colors on the uncovered area. To make ink for copper plates</p>
<p><em>Continued...</em></p>
<p>These rollers are good for printing promptly with cut cartons different kinds of pastes.</p>
<p>One can place the plates among the linens when the lye is quite fine, or also in a pot.</p>
<p><strong>Elsewhere_Medieval Ink Recipes:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Iron gall ink:</strong> The black ink that was used in medieval Europe is called iron-gall ink. There are hundreds of recipes for making iron-gall ink, but they have a few things in common. These things are gallnuts, iron vitriol (a. k. a. copperas), and gum arabic. Many recipes also use rainwater and wine.</p>
<p><strong>RECIPE FOR IRON GALL INK</strong></p>
<p><strong>Preparation time</strong>: Approximately three days.</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Take a jar and fill it with eight pounds of rainwater.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Add half a pound of small gallnuts and crush them.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Put the jar on the fire and boil until the water with the gallnuts is reduced by half.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> Take three ounces of gum arabic and grind it.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> Add the gum to the mixture.</p>
<p><strong>6.</strong> Boil until reduced by half again and remove the jar from the fire.</p>
<p><strong>7.</strong> In a separate jar, take four ounces of vitriol and one pound of warm wine and mix them.</p>
<p><strong>8.</strong> Add the mixture little by little to the ink while stirring.</p>
<p><strong>9.</strong> Leave to rest for two days.</p>
<p><strong>10.</strong> After the two days, stir the ink everyday four times with a stick.</p>
<p>There were two completely different types of ink. The first is carbon ink, made of charcoal or lamp-black mixed with a gum. The second is metal-gall ink, usually iron gall, made by mixing a solution of tannic acids with ferrous sulphate (copperas); it too requires added gum, but as a thickener rather than as an adhesive.</p>

<p>CUTTIING QUILL PENS</p>
<p><strong>4-RESEARCH</strong></p>
<p><strong>Historical question</strong></p>
<p>I’m interested in the crossover between printmaking and sculpture in casting letters in form of casting <strong>handwriting</strong>. To what end one would wish to cast handwriting? The earlier annotations conclude that this was possibly a whimsical idea to try out. It is not clear it is for purposes relating to text and printed material such as signing, using embossed lettering in a manuscript or even using for relief printing or for physical application to three dimensional surfaces.:</p>
<p>-embossed lettering in texts, seals, signum manus</p>
<p>-writing as sculpture or relief element in 3 dimensional forms.</p>

<p><strong>Introduction: 1000w</strong></p>
<p>In a few lines that read almost like a sketch, the “Molded letter paper” recipe on fol.131r of BnF Ms. Fr. 640 brings together two categories of major interest of the book (casting and printmaking) in one bold, vague stroke. The author-practitioner describes an idea of making molds out of handwriting to be casted. It is however not clear what is cast with or for.</p>
<p>Making 3 dimensional letters in some way constitutes an interesting intersection between printmaking and sculpture. A large portion of the manuscript is dedicated to mold-making and casting, a good portion of that is on casting living things, small and thin things but this recipe stands out as a unique one casting a gesture, action performed by the artist, and in this case the author-practinner.</p>
<p>In the two earlier annotations, very little is found on the background of this recipe</p>
<p><strong>INQUIRY 1500w</strong></p>
<p>This annotation concerns itself the motivation for such act and the potential uses of raised hand-writing in the context of early modern europe. It constitutes of reading the recipe, reconstruction the recipe searching similar recipes from the time. It also includes Looking at objects and prints that feature this use or similar techniques. It concludes with further speculations of its use and meaning at the time and some contemporary variations based on current material and technology.</p>
<p><strong>-The elements</strong></p>
<p>To do so, it is helpful to break down this short recipe into its thematic and material components. On one hand, the task implies transforming a gestural free form writing as opposed to casting individual letters.</p>
