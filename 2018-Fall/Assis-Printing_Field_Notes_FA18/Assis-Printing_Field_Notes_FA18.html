<p>Process:</p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>I began by using the wider lino cutter in order to cut straight lines around the borders sketched earlier.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>I needed to trace the pencil lines with a marker since it was hard for me to follow them easily in the lighting i was working with.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>This was harder than I thought it would be. To maintain a straight line required slow and steady movement with the linocutter into along the lines, with occasional jiggling of the tool in order to move forward in areas of more resistance.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>After this I took a finer linocutter and cut fine lines around the outlines of my design. Both inside and out.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>I then proceeded with the thicker linocutter to cut out everything between the design and the border.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>I recieved a woodblock in order to sketch a design on it in pencil.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>I then covered the block with a piece of paper and took it back home in my backpack.</p>

<p>Tools:</p>
<p>4x6” Copper Plate</p>
<p>Goddard’s Brass &amp; Copper Polish</p>
<p>Newsprint</p>
<p>Process:</p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Before engraving, it was necessary to polish the copper plate.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>The plate was nearly non-reflective as imperfections on the surface of the plate were visible.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>I used Brass and Copper polish and newsprint to polish the plate</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>I wonder what early modern engravers would have used to polish plates.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>The smell of the Brass and Copper polish was difficult to bear, and upon extracting some on the copper plate from the bottle, my eyes immediately began to tear.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Doing this on a regular basis without a mask could possibly be detrimental to one’s health.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Working in small circular motions, I rubbed the surface with a newsprint as hard and thoroughly as I could. After only a few minutes, my hand began to feel sore. I continued until the polish was almost gone from the plate.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>In order to get a good polish, the measure of which was ‘to see my eyelashes’ on the copper plate, I had to repeat this three times. At the end, the surface reflected myself like a mirror.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>I then repeated this for the other side of the plate as well.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>A few additional thoughts came to mind during this process:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>The process of printing, or even engraving, begins much before the design is even sketched out. Polishing the copper plate is a necessary step in the process, and even cutting the copper plate to the correct dimensions. The process goes all the way back to sourcing the copper and manipulating it into a plate, establishing a network of skilled labourers with very specific knowledge and working processes that goes into the making of one engraving.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>My arm being sore so quickly was a clear sign that I wasn’t used to doing this kind of work. This made me reflect about the division of labor inside and outside of a workshop. The roles of workshop workers, from the apprentice to the master, could very well vary and rely on physical attributes and predispositions no less than mental ones. This is not to say that there is no thought that goes into physically demanding processes - to know the best motions to polish a plate, how much polish to use, and when it is polished enough, requires specific knowledge that is tacit and physical, and intellectual.</p>

<p><strong>Subject: Engraving a copper plate</strong></p>
<p>Materials:</p>
<p>Polished Copper Plate</p>
<p>Burin</p>
<p>Etching needle</p>
<p>Ruler</p>
<p>Process:</p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>First I gridded the copper plate based on measurements from a predetermined design given to us. The process was the same as the woodblock (see above) with points marked according to measurements, and then a ruler used to draw lines between those points.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>To do this, I use an etching needle and a ruler. It required just the weight of the needle itself, with no more pressure applied, to achieve a light mark on the copper plate for the grid. When it felt as though there is resistance when moving the etching needle, that was because too much pressure was applied and the needle dug into the plat too much.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>The physical interaction with the copper plate and the etching needle for the first time allowed me to realize the how soft copper is, compared to what I had previously thought.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Moving the etching needle lightly on the copper plate also revealed that no material is being subtracted from the plate in this process. This is part of the properties of a metal.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>To begin engraving, I needed to learn how to hold the burin. This is much less straight forward as I thought. Multiple demonstrations did not help, and only after 5 attempts that were corrected by my intructor (Ad Steijnman), did I put the burin to the copper plate.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>I touched the burin to the plate at a 45 degree angle, pushed slightly into the plate, and then moved the burin to nearly 145 degrees and started pushing forward. The burin was supposed to move forward like a knife on butter, but encountered much resistance while moving the burin forward. I tried to correct my handling of the burin, and play with the degrees relative to the plate, but nothing helped.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>My instructor tried to use the burin on the copper plate as well, and encountered much resistance as well. He determined the burin’s edge had a flaw in it and gave me a different burin.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Using this burin, and already getting a grasp of how to hold it in the previous few attemps, it really was like sliding a knife on butter. A copper coil came out at the end of the line. It was surprisingly easy to keep a straight line - Much more than with the linocut.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>It is evident that different materials react differently, and lend themselves to different kinds of lines, shapes and designs.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>After a few lines, the position of my fingers as per my intructor’s instructions felt awkward, and I moved my fingers around a bit to find a more comfortable position that did not compromise the process of engraving. Straight lines, butter-like movement and a continuous curl of copper were a measure of this.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Skipping of the burin on the copper occurs a number of times when trying to work fast. To avoid this, the key was to work slowly and play around with the angle of the burin as I engraved.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>It was difficult at times to hold the plate in place.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>When making curved lines, the process was similar but I did find it was easier if I moved the plate around a bit as well.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>When making circular lines, the key was to turn around the plate in addition to the burin.</p>

<p>The shading lines I did not transfer. There was a process of interpertation in the copying of the design, since in order to not copy every line, I decided myself which lines were critical for the transfer of the design and which weren’t.

<p>My design had a frame. I took the knife and cut a 45 degree angle groove away from the line of the frame.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This required about 5-6 incisions per line in order to get a sufficient depth for the cut.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>I proceeded to incise all of the outlines, and incise lines at the top of the design to resemble the original.</p>

<li><blockquote>
<p>I then cut a 45 degree angle cut a few millimeters outside of line cut for the border, thus creating deep V-shaped grooves.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>It found it easier to cut across the grain rather than with it. This might be because the grain lines forced me to use more pressure in order to avoid the knife from shifting with them.</p>

<p>This was very labor intesive, and required a great deal of force to be applied with my hand. After I finished cutting the frame outline my hand was so sore, I had to stop.</p>

<p>I began by using a burin to engrave the outermost vertical line on the right side of the plate.

<li><blockquote>
<p>I only had one plate to use, so mistakes were unacceptable. The process therefore was very slow and calculated.

<p>I place the plate inside an ~10% acid bath solution</p>

<p>What kind of acid solutions were they using in the early modern era? How would they procure them or make them? Would every workshop have their own formula? What were the tools they were using to not get hurt in the process?</p>

<li><blockquote>
<p>Every minute, I brushed the top of the plate with a feather, while still in the acid bath, to remove excess residue from the plate.</p>

<li><blockquote>
<p>This was a very delicate process in order to not harm the beeswax coating.</p>

</ul></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>After 5 minutes, I took the plate out of the acid bath and rinsed it in a bath of water.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>I then let it dry and checked the depth of the grooves with an etching needle.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>I decided the grooves were not deep enough, and placed the plate in the acid bath for another 5 minutes, repeating the steps in the previous bath soak.</p>

<p>After it had dried, I heated the plate on a hotplate until the wax had melted, and then brushed the melted wax off of the plate.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>I then rubbed it with vegetable oil to remove any excess material, and then washed it with soap and water.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>The next step was using a bevel tool in order to bevel the edges of this plate and the copper plate. I secured the plate to the table and proceeded to cut off the edges with the tool. It was hard to use the tool, and required a lot of finesse. It was also very physically demanding.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Some might have a natural predisposition to this, some less, begging questions about work division in the early modern workshop.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Mishandling the bevel tool, or being too cavalier with it, cause it to incise an unwanted few lines on my copper plate. After this I put the tool down and worked much more of my plate with the tool I used to clip off the coils of the engraving.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>The copper was much tougher to bevel than the zinc, and required much more force.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>I then proceeded to sand the copper plate under water with a sanding paper, and then polished the plate as previously polished.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>During the sanding process, I tried to eliminate the line that I acidentaly made with the bevel tool, but with no success.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>I used the sandpaper to round out the edges of the plate as well.</p>

<p>INKING:</p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>First, blots of ink were put on the plate using a spatula and then a uniform coat of ink was spread on the plate using a peice of cardboard.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>The viscosity and color of the ink made it clear how percise and unique each ink recipe much be. Question that arose immediately were whether printing workshops were making their own inks,, if not, who was and as an extension to that question - what were their guild affiliations. Those who were making the inks needed to know what ink would be good for what process in order to make them in the right consistancy, therefore necessitating a knowledge of the materials and process of inking a plate.</p>

<p>Process:</p>

<li><blockquote>
<p>A coat of ink was put on a plate and then picked up with a roller.</p>

<li><blockquote>
<p>The ink was applied evenly with a roller to the raised surface of the block.</p>

<p>The inked block was placed on a paper and then on the press. Printing paper was put on top of the block, and then another peice of paper. On top of those a peice of cloth was put carfully so as not to move the paper on the woodblock.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>As I ran the woodblock through the press, there was no resistance. The press was apparently not adjusted to the height of the woodblock. The result on the paper was just due to transfer of ink from laying down the paper firmly on the woodblock:</p>

<p>Questions and more:</p>
<p>As the process come to its conclusions, a significant number of questions have already been risen throughout the process regarding the early modern period. These involve the division of labor inside and outside of the studio and workshop; the types of materials used and the ways in which materials were made and procured; How did the properties of different materials and tools affect the final products; The types of tools available to the practitioner and the interactions between the body and the tools; Where does the process begin and where does it end? Could we possibly shift to think about networks of operators that all have influence on one another instead of a single master?; What were the processes of troubleshooting problems and understanding processes in pretexts of pre-modern science?; Injuries were most likely a common thing in the workshop - how were they incurred, and how were they treated (both medically and as workers)?; What were the quantities of output that were expected from a practitioner?; The relationships between designing and interpreting designs or translating them - even across the same media, and even when designed for a specific media; What did it mean to <em>copy</em> someone’s work, especially in the age of printing?; How clear cut were the distinctions between intellectual and physical work? What do these definitions entail?</p>
