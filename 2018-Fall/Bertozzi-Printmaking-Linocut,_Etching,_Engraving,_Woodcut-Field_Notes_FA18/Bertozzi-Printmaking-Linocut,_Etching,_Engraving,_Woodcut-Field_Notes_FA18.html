My design was fairly simple, so I didn’t have to worry about accidentally cutting away the wrong section, but if I had wanted to avoid accidentally doing that on a more detailed design, I would have colored in the portions that I didn’t want to cut with the pencil to make a clear visual reference for myself before beginning the cutting). Because my design included letters, I had to draw them as mirror images so that they would result in a correct print.</p>

<p>I began by cutting the areas next to the areas I wanted to print in black, essentially making a border using negative space around the positive space. I didn’t know this at the time, but when Ad described the woodcutting process to us in class on a later date, it turned out that this is the approach that would be used in woodcutting, which surprised me but also made a lot of sense. I created this barrier using the very fine head to make it clear in my mind where to stop cutting once I switched over to the larger head and began carving away bigger spaces of white.</p>

<p>Thoughts/Reflections</p>
<p>Because of the way in which linocuts (and woodcuts, and perhaps all kinds of relief) are inked and printed, we each began the linocut image transfer process by drawing a border around all edges of the blank linocut we received. As opposed to intaglio printing, where everything that is printed is cut into the plate and then all excess ink is wiped away, everything to be printed in the relief style of printing is left level with the surface of the block and everything not to be printed is cut away, and no excess ink is wiped away, meaning that ink will sometimes remain in the recessed (i.e. not printed) portions of the block after it is inked. The border, therefore, acts as a solid level around the cut and helps prevent the paper from smooshing too far into the cut away portions of the block and picking up that excess ink. It also helps to create even pressure during the printing process and ensures that no part of the paper is printed “more” than other parts. None of this is necessary in intaglio printing because of the reasons I mentioned above. Given how borders also function stylistically in an image, however, the process of making all the different kinds of prints made me curious about whether intaglio print artists would have added in a border not because of any material or functional necessity, but rather because of its stylistic features. I also wondered whether intaglio printmakers would include a border in their design because they were intentionally attempting to mimic the result of a woodcut print.</p>
<p>Another question: I still am not sure why stamping techniques were so much less prevalent in the kind of paper printmaking we are talking about. This idea about borders is interesting to me from this perspective, because theoretically, rearranging the printing process as a stamping process where the block was pressed down on the paper instead of the other way around would eliminate the need to maintain a border around the image.</p>

<p><strong>Subject: Overview of Etching, Engraving, and Woodblock Prints / Plate polishing</strong></p>
<p>In the lab, Ad Stijnman explained how to execute the various printmaking processes we would be trying in class, namely etching, engraving, and woodblock cutting. What has been so fascinating about thinking of these processes all together in a single conceptual group of <em>printmaking</em> has been realizing that we have to think about why it is that we group them all together. After all, the tools that go into making each particular process are completely different. The ways that you manipulate your body in order to execute each particular process is completely different. And even on a more fundamental level, the differences between intaglio and relief printing are so vast. Not only do the tools differ, but so does the inking and printing process itself.</p>
<p>Engraving materials:</p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Copper plate</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Copper polish</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Dry point needle</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Burin</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Ruler</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Felt marker</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<p>Etching materials:</p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Zinc plate (though copper plates could also be used)</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Copper polish</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>paper</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Dry point needle</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Beeswax (or some kind of acid resistant material that melts when heated but solidifies at room temperature)</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>feather</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Hot plate</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Acidic liquid</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<p>Woodblock</p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Block of hard, fine-grained wood</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Carving knife</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Chisel</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Ruler</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<p>Some thoughts: Even the process of writing out what each method requires (and thinking about how available all of the given materials are generally), it is pretty easy to understand why it was that woodblock printing was an earlier and more widespread kind of printing, whereas engraving (as a printing method in particular) came later and in a more geographically limited zone and etching (as a printing method) was an even later development.</p>
<p>What I did in the Lab</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><blockquote>
<p>Using paper and copper polish, polish both sides of the copper plate until they reflected an image of my face clear enough that I could make out my eyelashes</p>
</blockquote>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><blockquote>
<p>This took much longer than I had anticipated, and even then, I probably could have continued going. But that would have cut into my time actually engraving. There is something to be said for <em>doing</em> even when the conditions are not ideal.</p>

<p><strong>Location: The Lab</strong></p>
<p><strong>Subject: Attempting to engrave / polishing the zinc plate and laying the etching ground</strong></p>
<p>I arrived at the lab at 12:30pm to find that the other students already there were working on polishing zinc plates that we would use for our etchings. I got a zinc plate and began polishing it. Much like the copper plate, I found that it took a very long time to polish the plate to the right level of shine (where eyelashes were visible). My plate ended up resembling a vignette by the time I decided to move on. I could see my eyelashes in the center of the plate, but they grew blurrier towards the outer edges of the plate. I decided to embrace this as a retroactively intentional feature of my printmaking contribution to the class’ collective printmaking experience. After all, where is the fun in everyone printing with a perfectly polished plate??</p>
<p>I then moved back to my copper plate for engraving. Using a ruler and the felt marker, I marked off the measurements for the grid of my design (once on one end of the plate and another time on the other to ensure that my lines were straight) and then connected them using the ruler and the dry point needle. Rather than cut away at the copper, the dry point needle simply displaces the metal around the area you draw. This line is fairly shallow and I suspect that it will not show up much in the print. I then moved on to the actual engraving process, using the burin I listed as a tool in my earlier entry.</p>
<p>I spent a long time thinking about how to hold the burin. Instructions on how to position the body always interest me, because of the way the ideal and the real interact in bodily action. When describing how to hold the burin, Ad used his own hand as an example and used language that posited the existence of some ideal universal hand in order to describe holding the burin with his words. For much the same reason I always struggle to understand the instructions that yoga teachers give when describing a posture or movement, I found the language describing how to hold the burin quite opaque. After all, my hand is so different from Ad’s, and it is different still from the ideal hand Ad was describing with his words. It was for this reason that I had to actually spend time trying to hold the burin in my own non-platonically ideal hand before I arrived at a physical sense of what it felt like to hold the burin properly in my hand was. And even then, this proper holding of the burin was more like a range of possible grips rather than a single correct grip.</p>
<p>Onto the engraving. I began with the upper lefthand corner of the design Ad had given us. Essentially, I began by trying to engrave a single straight line. Although I had many false starts, I eventually found the angle by which I could cut a clean smooth line without using much pressure or force, and ended up with a series of very satisfying copper curls at the end of each cut.</p>

<p>I also really appreciated that the design we were using was one made for strictly pedagogical purposes. Rather than getting caught up in whether my design looked the way I wanted to, I was able to incorporate the mistakes (such as where my lines went too far or where they were not parallel) not as failures, but as good practice.</p>
<p>After spending some time practicing straight cuts, Ad explained how to lay the etching ground. He described two different kinds of ground, beeswax and a mixture of wax, asphalt, etc. For my own plate, I decided to try the beeswax. Using a clamp, I held the imperfectly polished zinc plate over the hot plate inside of the fume hood. After it had some time to heat, I touched a blob of beeswax to the plate to see if it was hot enough to melt the wax. It was, so I frantically (but in a dignified manner) spread the blob of wax all over the plate. I then took a blotting tool and rubbed the wax so that it covered the entire plate evenly. For the part that was covered by the clamp, I placed the plate on a towel and, while it was still residually hot, touched the uncovered zinc with the beeswax. Once the wax dried, I could see that my technique for spreading the wax evenly had not been good enough. The wax covering the plate was very streaky and uneven, and there were some parts that appeared not covered at all. I reheated the plate, melted more wax onto it, and tried spreading it evenly over the plate with a feather instead. This worked well, but there were still some portions close to where the clamp was holding the plate that I couldn’t cover well with the wax. Ad suggested that I simply cover that section with tape before biting it in the acid, but I think I want to see what this “foul biting” will end up looking like.</p>

<p>I decided to freehand the design for my etched plate based on a kind of plant I had seen on a visit to the Cloisters that I quite liked. I drew this out of the top right corner of my plate, so it will print on the top left corner. I then drew some enoki, my favorite kind of mushrooms, down in the bottom corner. Because I had embraced the fact that I was practicing and learning via trial and error, not making a beautiful design, I decided to see how crosshatching would look, so I drew some cross hatches in the opposite corner from the plant design. I also drew some hatches and shading lines within the mushroom and plant design, just to see how it would be rendered in print.</p>

<p>The morning before we actually did the printing, I did my best to finish the engraving process. I actually really enjoy the process of engraving and had hoped to be able to spend more time on it, but so it goes.</p>
<p>Because I had spent quite a bit of time attempting straight lines earlier, I worked this time on the curved lines and cross-hatching sections. The curved lines were incredibly difficult. I had a piece of paper underneath the copper plate so that I could rotate instead of trying to rotate the burin while cutting in order to get the curved lines, as per Ad’s instructions. Regardless, I found myself really wanting to move the burin to make the curved cuts. You can see that none of the curves I cut were continuous. They are full of starts and stops and skids off the surface of the plate when I lost control of the burin (no hands were harmed in the making of the engraving!!)</p>

<p>The cross hatching was a fascinatingly different experience because the cuts were happening across lines that I had already cut. It felt much more “bumpy.”</p>
<p>I had also noticed that my hands were tarnishing the plate. I was initially very worried about this tarnishing, but when I began to sand the plate down, the tarnishing disappeared immediately.</p>

<p>After working with the burin for a bit, the tip of my pointer finger definitely feels numb. I can imagine that an experienced engraver would develop a thick callus over their fingers. I know that the process of making <em>sudare</em> screens in Japan, my hands changed: I developed calluses on the parts of my fingers that were frequently in contact with rope. The relationship between a craft and the body producing it remains deeply fascinating to me. I’ve been thinking about the role of repetitive motion in producing craft knowledge--how do the changes that occur in the body via repeating a craft--injuries/changes in weight placement/etc.--change what the craftsperson knows and the kind of knowledge they have access to? What does this say about the body-brain relationship???</p>

<p>Comments:</p>
<p>The thickness of the ink surprised me quite a lot, as typically think of ink as the water based ink you use in East Asian calligraphy or quills.</p>
<p>I was surprised by how clearly the lines of my etched print turned out. Because the lines were so thin and shallow, Ad had warned me that the lines might not show up very well. Especially given that the ink was not the most finely grounded ink. But instead of the lines being grainy, as Ad warned me they might be, they turned out quite clear. The foul biting portion of the print was also fascinating to observe, as the quality of the shape was so different from that of the lines I had intentionally created.</p>

<p>Comments:</p>
<p>I tried the relief process many different times. The first couple of times, Carolin helped me hold everything in place, and the prints turned out very clear. When I was doing all of my own holding, the paper obviously had shifted, so the print was a bit blurrier.</p>

<p>While Carolin was helping me roll out the ink, she got to a point where she had put too much ink on the flat panel. She noticed immediately. “You can tell because the sound of the roller on the ink just doesn’t sound right.” And indeed, when I paid more attention to it, I noticed that the roller made a much more spongy, squishy sound. “It should sound more like velvet.”</p>
<p>At one point, Carolin and I decided to increase the pressure of the press to see how it changed the image. The increased pressure definitely forced the paper to squish more into the block, where it picked up more of the unintentional ink.</p>

<p>All of the prints made quite apparent the parts of the block that I hadn’t cut deeply enough. It made me realize the desire to change and alter your plates.</p>
<p>We then made a ghost print of the plate, where we ran it through without re-inking it. This print definitely emphasized the three-dimensionality of the printing process more clearly than the black ink ones.</p>

<p>GENERAL REFLECTIONS ON THE ENTIRE PRINTING PROCESS</p>
<p>I didn’t have time to try woodcutting, but I’m hoping that I will have some spare time later in the semester to try a couple of cuts and think about it comparatively with the linocut process.</p>
<p>While I definitely thought this before going through all of the printing processes, the actual making of the prints reinforced in my mind how unintuitive the intaglio printing process is. There are so many more steps you have to go through --logically and physically-- in order to arrive at a completed intaglio print.</p>
<p>The question of stamping is still unresolved in my mind. Why are woodblocks printed with the block underneath and the paper on top?</p>
<p>The mind-body relationship as it related to “bodily knowledge,” particularly in terms of how doing particular techniques alters the body/the mind of the person doing them. Is the body a tool? Is the mind a tool? ← These are very unrefined thoughts that I would have to do a lot more thinking/doing to tease out more concretely.</p>
