<p>Pounced design for scratching satin</p>
<p>After you have pounced with flour or ground chalk, in order that the dots of the pounced design are not erased, follow the trace with glair beaten with the milk or bark of a fig tree, which will immediately make it clear up like water, &amp; without becoming thick, it will keep the trace that you will follow again &amp; scratch with d a piece of glass or a pen-knife.</p>
<p>I had two primary questions driving my recreation of this recipe. The first was to try to figure out what the finished product of the recipe was. The term “scratching satin” does not refer to anything in English, and the actual instructions in the recipe are sufficiently vague so as not to be clear what precisely the author-practitioner is describing. My second question was tied to the larger annotation project I was working on and had to do with how pouncing (i.e. tracing a design onto a piece of paper, poking holes along the lines of the design, and rubbing some kind of fine powder through the holes to transfer the design onto another surface) worked as an image transfer technique.</p>
<p>In beginning this reconstruction, I faced two major material sourcing challenges. The biggest challenge presented in the recipe was the requirement of fig tree milk. Fig trees produce a milk-like white sap (which is also a kind of latex) that leaks out from the tops of the figs and and branches when snapped, which the author-practitioner specifies should be mixed with egg white and painted onto the design once it has been pounced onto the satin. However, fig tree sap cannot be purchased in and of itself, and access to fig trees in New York City is very limited. Additionally, fig trees do not always leak this sap, and as I was attempting the reconstruction in the fall/winter, it was highly unlikely that I would be able to find a fig tree that was producing sap that I could easily harvest. However, because the reconstruction was mostly for the sake of testing pouncing as an image transfer technique, I decided that a substitute material that would at least allow for a proof of concept of the recipe that gestured at what the author-practitioner imagined “scratched satin” to be was sufficient. After an email conversation with Lila Goldenberg and some follow-up research, I decided that natural latex from the rubber tree, which is used frequently in special effects make-up, was a good enough substitute, given its chemical similarities to fig tree milk (i.e. fig tree latex). I sourced some <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Monster-Liquid-Latex-Creates-Zombie/dp/B00YQBYO1K/ref=sr_1_5_a_it?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1546535831&amp;sr=8-5&amp;keywords=liquid+rubber+latex"><em>make-up latex made from natural rubber latex</em></a> that had a few added ingredients and decided to go ahead with the reconstruction using this.</p>

<p>The second material sourcing concern for this reconstruction was the satin. Satin is a particular weave of fabric in which the weft threads float over the warp threads. The higher number of floats in the weave lead to the fabric having a higher luster than a plain weave. Because I was unsure of what the finished product looked like and therefore had no way of knowing how important the properties of the fabric’s weave and material were to the finished product, it was important that I have a fabric as close to what the author-practitioner would have imagined so as not to introduce any unnecessary variables. I consulted with Sophie and decided that a 100% silk satin-weave fabric was the most accurate material for the reconstruction. Because their fabrics are trusted by the Met, I reached out to Testfabrics, Inc. for a selection of their silk fabrics. Their <a href="http://testfabrics.com/product-detail.php?id=T0RnPQ==&amp;pid=88"><em>Silk Charmeuse</em></a> was the only satin-weave fabric they sold, so I ordered meter of that.</p>

<p>I then used a sewing needle to poke holes along the lines of my design. I found that the sewing needle was difficult to grip so switched to a sewing pin, which actually has a little grip on it.</p>

<p>This went more smoothly. Because I had never pounced before, I didn’t know how close together the holes should be or how large they needed to be for the charcoal/other powder to pass through. I started with charcoal instead of the chalk/flour specified in the recipe because it was readily available as an already prepared pouncing bag in the lab and because my fabric was white and I wanted to make sure I could see the design clearly once it was transferred. So after I had finished poking holes all around the design, I tested it out onto a piece of scrap paper. I placed my pounced paper onto the scrap paper and rubbed the charcoal pouncing bag over the pouncing paper. Again, I had no idea how long I should rub for, or how hard I should rub. Once I rubbed over the whole design, I lifted the pouncing bag and the pouncing paper to see how the design had transferred. Not much charcoal had been pressed through onto the scrap paper, so I went over the pouncing paper with the sewing pin again, making the holes a bit larger.</p>

<p>I tested this again and found that the design transferred much better, but was still not as clear as I had hoped.</p>

<p>Still, I decided that it was good enough for my purposes so pounced the design onto a piece of the satin. What I found was that the satin actually did a much better job of holding the charcoal powder in place, probably because the charcoal actually sat in the fabric rather than just atop the surface of the paper. The design was very clear on the satin.</p>

<p>I separated out the white of an egg into a small bowl. Because the author-practitioner gives no indication of the amount of fig tree milk that should be mixed in, I didn’t know how much of the rubber latex to add. So I started with a dropper filled with the latex and added a couple drops at a time. I had hoped that the latex would at some point turn the egg white “clear up like water,” but it was unclear in the recipe whether this was referring to the egg white when fig tree milk was added, or to the chalk/flour when it was traced over with the mixture of egg white and fig tree milk. As I didn’t actually test it with real fig tree milk, I can’t be sure, but I suspect that the a-p was referring to the chalk or flour clearing up like water when traced, as the egg white and rubber latex mixture I tried mixing together did not blend well and remained a murky translucent white substance. It remained unclear to me how much fig tree milk was being called for, so I added a few more drops to the egg white, mixed, and proceeded with that.</p>

<p>Using a thin brush, I began painting the egg white mixture over the design I had pounced onto the fabric. The black dots of the charcoal powder remained clear and unaffected, and the egg white mixture spread out noticeably along the floats of the satin weave, meaning it bled more when I was painting against the weave than along it.</p>

<p>Once I finished, I took a carving knife meant for woodblock cutting (as it was available in the lab and easy to grip for the kind of cuts I was making) and traced over the design again with the knife. I was unsure what the a-p meant with the term “scratched satin,” and didn’t know whether I should cut completely through the fabric (a technique that would have been referred to as pinking satin in English around the a-p’s time) or scratch the surface of the fabric to cut some of the top floats but leave the body of the fabric intact. The design I made was primarily for testing the latter method, as it could not be cut all the way through all around, so I went around the design scratching the top of the fabric. Because the charcoal dots were still very clear, it was difficult to see what affect the scratching was having on the fabric, so I painted a line with the egg white mixture elsewhere on the fabric and scratched two lines, one over the egg white and one next to the egg white. Both scratches resulted in a visible line that appeared raised on the surface of the fabric.</p>

<p>Next to this, I painted another egg white line and this time cut two lines all the way through the fabric, one over the egg white and another next to it. What I found was that the cut I had made over the egg white line did not appear to fray much, whereas the cut on the fabric alone had visibly fraying threads. Whereas the scratched lines appeared the same regardless of whether or not the egg white had been painted on before, the egg white mixture appeared to act as a kind of reinforcement for the cut lines.</p>

<p>Having found this, Tillmann and I did further research into the original French for “scratching satin,” which was “esgratigner sur le satin.” We found that the term <em>esgratigner le satin</em> appeared to be a common and set phrase in French, which a number of 16th century dictionaries define as the act of slashing/cutting through satin with a knife or specialized tool. This supported the hypothesis that the recipe was one for pinking satin rather than scratching the surface of the satin, which further reinforced what the reconstruction revealed about the function of the egg white mixture when the satin was cut through rather than simply scratched.</p>

<p><strong>Subject: Scratching Satin Attempt 2</strong></p>
<p>Based on my earlier findings, I wanted to test the recipe out from the beginning with the assumption that I was creating a design for pinking satin. I also wanted to test how flour worked as a pouncing powder. So I brought the materials to my apartment and created a new design. Because I was going to cut the lines completely through, the design needed to be simple and less pictoral than my first attempt had been. I went with a simple design of horizontal, vertica, and diagonal lines to test whether the cuts were different depending on how they were oriented in terms of the fabric’s weave, which I drew onto a piece of paper and poked out with the sewing pin. I placed this paper on top of a piece of satin and used my fingers (for want of a proper pouncing bag) to rub some King Arthur White Whole Wheat flour (i.e. what I had on hand at my apartment) through the holes. When I lifted the pouncing paper off, the fabric appeared unchanged. However, a closer look revealed that the flour had indeed transferred onto the fabric along the pounced holes of my pattern, but it was very hard to see because the fabric and the flour were both white. I painted over the flour with the egg white mixture and then cut through the fabric along the lines of the pattern with the knife. I then pounced the design again lower onto the fabric and cut through the lines without painting the egg white mixture on first. Just as before, the non-egg white cuts frayed much more than the cuts made on top of the egg white mixture. I tested this out with a few more free hand lines that I painted with the egg white and then cut, and it held true each time.</p>

<p>Conclusions:</p>
<p>Based on my reconstructions, which made use of a substituted material for the fig tree milk and white fabric, I have concluded the following:</p>
<p>The recipe is likely a recipe for pinking/slashing patterns onto satin fabric. Pinked/slashed satin fabric was very stylish during the 16th century.</p>
<p>The egg white and fig tree milk mixture LIKELY functions as a kind of structural reinforcement to strengthen the fabric that is weakened when it is cut and the threads are severed and left to fray. Given how fashionable slashed satin garments were during the time period and the fact that none of the descriptions of pinked satin/<em>esgratigner le satin</em> mention any kind of reinforcement, further reconstruction testing and historical research more dedicated to the actual slashing of the satin (as opposed to the image transfer technique of pouncing that was my primary concern) could prove very enlightening as far as the historical practice of slashing/pinking satin for fashionably textured garments is concerned.</p>
<p>Further testing using actual fig tree milk would be more concretely conclusive re: my hypothesis that the liquid acts as a structural reinforcement.</p>
<p>Further testing using colored fabric may help reveal whether it was indeed the chalk/flour that turns clear like water when painted with the egg white mixture, especially if it can be tested with actual fig tree milk as well, as the fig tree milk could plausibly mix differently with the egg white than my rubber latex did.</p>
